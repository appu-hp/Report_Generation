Along with that, our QRs are card-acquiring because of RuPay credit cards going on QR. So, it started to earn sizable revenue because RuPay credit card on UPI actually is MDR-bearing, even today.\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora:** I should also just clarify, I think you mentioned something about margin. The margin is nearly identical between whether PPPL was acquiring or the partner banks who we are acquiring with right now. So, the margins are not different at all.\n\n**Mr. Pranav Gundlapalle:** Understood. Just to clarify, if you look at the RBI disclosures, PPPL had almost a 78% market share in what at least RBI calls as POS machines. Is it safe to assume that the market share has not declined since the last 12 to 18 months?\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** We increased that. So, yes, safe to assume that it did not decline. You have an eye, my friend. Thank you.\n\n**Mr. Pranav Gundlapalle:** Thank you. Those were my questions.\n\n**Moderator:** Thank you so much, Pranav. The next question is from Mr. Jayanth Kharote from Axis Capital. You may please ask your question.\n\n**Mr. Jayanth Kharote:** Thanks for the opportunity. And congrats on delivering positive earnings to the whole team. The first one is on this quarter's payments revenue. So, if I look at the device addition, POS device addition has been pretty strong. And if the net payment margins are north of 3 bps, is there a decline in the yields for the devices, QoQ?\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** UPI volume is not accounted for, for any revenue till the time-period final bonus is given or the grant is accepted. So, the yield looking less is not because of rental or any other thing or subscription fee that we charge from the merchant or any other thing. It is because growth of UPI effectively shows incrementally less bps payment processing because we only account for it in the quarter where we get the amount. And UPI is growing.\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora:** I'll just add a couple of things to that. We also get PIDF revenue, which is an incentive from the government. We also have certain incentives with our partner banks. So, there are a couple of smaller line items. But if you're looking literally quarter and quarter and getting to smaller margins of error, then there are a few other, much smaller variables that also play.\n\nAs a part of our overall subscription revenue per device, because we have become extremely efficient on capex and refurbishment, we are not looking to drive up subscription revenue per merchant necessarily. So, we have very much moved towards what is the lifetime value of this portfolio, which includes the subscription revenue, includes, for example, things like obviously these incentives, but also RuPay on UPI. And then also includes some attribution of the fact that some of these merchants can be upsold to merchant lending. So, we look at it in the holistic context rather than trying to drive up a single number.\n\n**Mr. Jayanth Kharote:** Actually, that feeds into my second question. I was going to ask now that do you see the POS market share having stabilized between the few players, and does this now open up headroom for looking at price hikes on these products?", "content_chunks": ["Surprisingly, all of our card-acquiring machines are card-acquiring.

The finance minister did say that she wants 1 billion UPI transactions per day in the next two to three years. So at some level, perhaps we are seeing a monetization which might add a bit of friction to growth. And we have a higher target in terms of growth. And I do understand that consumers will not be charged on UPI, but the perception sometimes in the market always is, whenever an MDR comes, the consumer will be paying and hence there's a bit of a friction. So do we still see this coming in the near future despite this entire target of 1 billion UPI transactions?\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** I do believe that there is a tremendous upside left and is ahead of UPI in the country. The finance minister is perfectly guided towards the size that we are expecting. And I do believe that it is the perfect target to chase. Consumers are not going to be charged, like I say. And I think in many cases, consumers' misunderstanding does exist. But at the same time, I don't think consumers will be charged. At the same time, how MDR shows up, it is the work, I do believe that NPCI and other bodies are doing it.\n\n**Mr. Sachin Salgaonkar:** Got it. And my last question, your thoughts in terms of how much AI could lead to cost reductions. I did see a statement in your press release saying that, this quarter, you did reduce some non-sales employee costs on the back of AI. So I just wanted to understand the potential for AI and what kind of savings we could see in the future.\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** I don't have a percentage, but I do want to tell you that more and more automation is coming in. Overall at large, more productivity per employee is showing up. We are not replacing the positions that get, let's say, emptied.\n\nSo we are clear about it that we will be not recruiting incrementally if somebody, let's say, goes out. So practically, it may not look like a drop, but it will continue to, as the cost of people decline, I do believe, because more and more productivity is showing up. And it is shocking to know what level of productivity can show up. I'm right now in Bangalore. We had a board meeting. I was yesterday doing my team reviews. It was shocking that level of insights, level of skill from a senior product manager that we typically expect. And here we had a global expert product manager. So it would be a dramatic improvement in the ability and capabilities of the company. So I do believe that cost will continuously reduce, but there is no sharp one-off, et cetera, kind of thing that we are expecting.\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora:** I just want to add that what I'm really excited about is that we have really leaned into this and we are doing a pretty good job of using AI's current capabilities. Of course, we can always do more. And obviously, the bigger trend is that AI also continues to get better. So whatever opportunities exist today to become smarter, more efficient, leaner, those opportunities will be even more six months from now, a year from now.

The finance minister did say that she wants 1 billion UPI transactions per day in the next two to three years. So at some level, perhaps we are seeing a monetization which might add a bit of friction to growth. And we have a higher target in terms of growth. And I do understand that consumers will not be charged on UPI, but the perception sometimes in the market always is, whenever an MDR comes, the consumer will be paying and hence there's a bit of a friction. So do we still see this coming in the near future despite this entire target of 1 billion UPI transactions?\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** I do believe that there is a tremendous upside left and is ahead of UPI in the country. The finance minister is perfectly guided towards the size that we are expecting. And I do believe that it is the perfect target to chase. Consumers are not going to be charged, like I say. And I think in many cases, consumers' misunderstanding does exist. But at the same time, I don't think consumers will be charged. At the same time, how MDR shows up, it is the work, I do believe that NPCI and other bodies are doing it.\n\n**Mr. Sachin Salgaonkar:** Got it. And my last question, your thoughts in terms of how much AI could lead to cost reductions. I did see a statement in your press release saying that, this quarter, you did reduce some non-sales employee costs on the back of AI. So I just wanted to understand the potential for AI and what kind of savings we could see in the future.\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** I don't have a percentage, but I do want to tell you that more and more automation is coming in. Overall at large, more productivity per employee is showing up. We are not replacing the positions that get, let's say, emptied.\n\nSo we are clear about it that we will be not recruiting incrementally if somebody, let's say, goes out. So practically, it may not look like a drop, but it will continue to, as the cost of people decline, I do believe, because more and more productivity is showing up. And it is shocking to know what level of productivity can show up. I'm right now in Bangalore. We had a board meeting. I was yesterday doing my team reviews. It was shocking that level of insights, level of skill from a senior product manager that we typically expect. And here we had a global expert product manager. So it would be a dramatic improvement in the ability and capabilities of the company. So I do believe that cost will continuously reduce, but there is no sharp one-off, et cetera, kind of thing that we are expecting.\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora:** I just want to add that what I'm really excited about is that we have really leaned into this and we are doing a pretty good job of using AI's current capabilities. Of course, we can always do more. And obviously, the bigger trend is that AI also continues to get better. So whatever opportunities exist today to become smarter, more efficient, leaner, those opportunities will be even more six months from now, a year from now. So we just fully leaned into this, and that, I think, is what really matters.\n\n**Mr. Sachin Salgaonkar:** Thank you both, and all the best for the future.\n\n**Moderator:** Thank you.

So I do believe that cost will continuously reduce, but there is no sharp one-off, et cetera, kind of thing that we are expecting.\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora:** I just want to add that what I'm really excited about is that we have really leaned into this and we are doing a pretty good job of using AI's current capabilities. Of course, we can always do more. And obviously, the bigger trend is that AI also continues to get better. So whatever opportunities exist today to become smarter, more efficient, leaner, those opportunities will be even more six months from now, a year from now.

The finance minister did say that she wants 1 billion UPI transactions per day in the next two to three years. So at some level, perhaps we are seeing a monetization which might add a bit of friction to growth. And we have a higher target in terms of growth. And I do understand that consumers will not be charged on UPI, but the perception sometimes in the market always is, whenever an MDR comes, the consumer will be paying and hence there's a bit of a friction. So do we still see this coming in the near future despite this entire target of 1 billion UPI transactions?\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** I do believe that there is a tremendous upside left and is ahead of UPI in the country. The finance minister is perfectly guided towards the size that we are expecting. And I do believe that it is the perfect target to chase. Consumers are not going to be charged, like I say. And I think in many cases, consumers' misunderstanding does exist. But at the same time, I don't think consumers will be charged. At the same time, how MDR shows up, it is the work, I do believe that NPCI and other bodies are doing it.\n\n**Mr. Sachin Salgaonkar:** Got it. And my last question, your thoughts in terms of how much AI could lead to cost reductions. I did see a statement in your press release saying that, this quarter, you did reduce some non-sales employee costs on the back of AI. So I just wanted to understand the potential for AI and what kind of savings we could see in the future.\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** I don't have a percentage, but I do want to tell you that more and more automation is coming in. Overall at large, more productivity per employee is showing up. We are not replacing the positions that get, let's say, emptied.\n\nSo we are clear about it that we will be not recruiting incrementally if somebody, let's say, goes out. So practically, it may not look like a drop, but it will continue to, as the cost of people decline, I do believe, because more and more productivity is showing up.
