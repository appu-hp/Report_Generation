If we see a continued growth in trading volumes in India, of course, in the last three or four months, there were some regulatory developments for the industry, which lowered the trading volumes, but now the business is growing again. So Paytm Money, which is our equity broking platform, we feel very interested in. And finally, advertising, where we think there's a lot of opportunities for us to make more advertising revenue.\n\nSo on the consumer side, we're starting the year with a lot of optimism, both on the base, which is the consumer, highly engaged consumers, a number of transactions and so on, as well as the monetization opportunities through those three or four areas of upsell that I talked about.\n\n**Rahul Jain**: Right, and just one more question. Just to understand how usage of this DLG has led to increase in the take rates of what should be the, with the changing evolving mix of DLG, what should be the ideal take rate for this segment? And secondly, how is it changing the perception of the lender in terms of approving the whitelisted potential merchant loan client from our perspective? Has that increased the threshold for the lenders?\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora**: Yeah, on the second question, I don't think we necessarily ask our lenders to change their behavior just because they are DLG and we also hope that they don't do that because we do want eventually to target a range bound and predictable expected credit loss. We think that that is a fundamental indicator that you are building a high quality franchise. So ultimately, as we said enough and more times, it is the lender's decision to say yes or no on loan but we don't see a change in behaviour nor do we encourage, request or expect a change in behaviour.\n\nThe expected credit losses on merchant lending has been quite positive since April, May last year, so we do not have concerns that FLDGs are making them less disciplined on credit losses and I think that is the good news. In terms of take rates, if you look at our historical take rates, it should be about 3-3.5% higher on the merchant loan side, which on a blended basis probably means about 2% higher for financial services, because obviously there's a percentage of it which is personal loans.\n\n**Rahul Jain**: You're saying 200 bps more than the past or I could not follow that?\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora**: 200 bps more than the past, i.e. compared to the period when we were not doing DLGs.\n\n**Rahul Jain**: And it ideally should go higher as the mix improves, right?\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora**: Well, higher or lower, it would depend a little bit on Personal Loan versus Merchant Loan mix and DLG versus non-DLG mix. Merchant loans do make us a slightly higher take rate anyway, compared to personal loans. So there would be various factors, but yeah.\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma**: But overall, it doesn't make commercial difference in a different direction. It is not a higher net rate actually.\n\n**Mr. Madhur Deora**: Just to be clear, merchant loan, when I say 2%, I mean, the reason I say 2% is because not all loans have FLDGs, right? So for loans, like for like, loans that don't have FLDG versus loans that have FLDG, if we are giving about, let's say, 3.5% FLDG, then we expect to make 3.5% more take rate.

Merchant loans do make us a slightly higher take rate anyway, compared to personal loans. So there would be various factors, but yeah.\n\n**Mr. Vijay Shekhar Sharma:** But overall, it doesn't make commercial difference in a different direction.

So for loans, like for like, loans that don't have FLDG versus loans that have FLDG, if we are giving about, let's say, 3.5% FLDG, then we expect to make 3.5% more take rate.
