    "\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "TITLE SELECTION RULES (STRICT)\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "1. **HIGHEST PRIORITY (CONTENT):** - Look at the text content immediately preceding the table data.\n",
    "   - If there is a specific table heading in the text (e.g., \"SUMMARIZED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT...\", \"Table 1: Revenue\", \"Segment Information\"), use that heading EXACTLY as it appears in the text.\n",
    "   - This overrides the Vespa title.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SECONDARY PRIORITY (VESPA):**\n",
    "   - ONLY if no specific heading is found in the text content, check the Vespa page title.\n",
    "   - Use the Vespa title only if it clearly describes the specific table being extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **FORMATTING:**\n",
    "   - If a title exists, prefix it with '### '.\n",
    "   - The title MUST appear BEFORE the table, never inside it.\n",
    "   - Do NOT invent titles. If neither source has a valid title, return null.\n",

    "TRUE FINANCIAL STATEMENT TABLE DEFINITION\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "A table is a TRUE financial statement table ONLY IF it represents:\n",
    "- Income statement / Comprehensive Income\n",
    "- Balance sheet / Financial Position\n",
    "- Cash flow statement\n",
    "- Statement of changes in equity\n",
    "\n",
    "The table MUST contain financial magnitudes (monetary figures) and multiple numeric rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "DESCRIPTION ARCHITECTURE (MANDATORY)\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "The \"description\" field must be a formal 2-paragraph analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Paragraph 1: Identification & Scope\n",
    "- Formally identify the statement (e.g., \"Consolidated Statement of Operations\").\n",
    "- Specify the reporting entity and the period covered (e.g., \"for the fiscal years ended December 31\").\n",
    "- State the currency and scale (e.g., \"presented in millions of USD, except per share data\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Paragraph 2: Structural Summary\n",
    "- Describe the flow of the table. (e.g., \"The statement begins with Revenue and flows through operating expenses and tax provisions to arrive at Net Income.\")\n",
    "- Mention key line items or sub-sections included (e.g., \"Includes breakdowns for Research & Development, Sales and Marketing, and General Administrative costs.\")\n",
    "- Explain what the table tells a reader about the company's health (e.g., \"This provides a view of the company's operational efficiency and bottom-line profitability over the comparative periods.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "CRITICAL CONTINUITY & MERGING RULE\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "If a statement is split into sections (e.g., \"Operating activities\", \"Investing activities\", \"Financing activities\"), you MUST MERGE them into ONE continuous table_markdown. DO NOT truncate the table after the first section.\n",
    "\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "RULES FOR THE TABLE (STRICT)\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "1. TITLES: Use the Vespa title if it's a formal name; otherwise, extract the heading from the content. Prefix with '### '.\n",
    "2. EXCLUSIONS: Do NOT extract narrative text, footnotes, or index tables. Only numeric financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "MANDATORY:\n",
    "- If table_markdown is present, \"description\" and \"investor_relevance\" MUST be populated with high-quality content.\n",

    "OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY)\n",
    "==================================================\n",

      "               Looking back on 2024, we see a global chemical industry in a challenging economic climate undergoing profound changes to deal with geopolitical uncertainty, shifting consumer preferences, and the ever-growing urgency to decarbonize. While key customer industries, like packaging, construction, and consumer goods, saw some growth in chemicals demand, others remained stagnant. In our own industry, persistent excess supply and low operating rates continued to pressure margins, particularly in Northeast Asia and Europe, where economic recovery lagged.\n",

Cost optimization and a focus on high-margin opportunities kept our EBITDA margin stable at 14%. Net income from continuing operations rose 61% to ▲2.10 Bn.

(US$ 2.57 Bn.) as of the end of 2024, including a synergy value of ▲3.04 Bn. (US$ 0.81 Bn.) realized in 2024.\n",

      "               A strong cash position and balance sheet have long been hallmarks of SABIC’s financial approach, ensuring resilience through industry cycles. Free cash flow remained strong at ▲6.16 Bn. (US$ 1.64 Bn.) in 2024, although lower than the prior-year. Net debt stood at ▲-3.01 Bn. (US$ -0.80 Bn.).\n",
      "\n",
      "               Despite the modest financial performance, 2024 was a year of measured progress in the execution of SABIC’s long-term strategy. We reinforced our foundation, advanced key transformation initiatives, and stayed focused on long-term value creation. Our emphasis on operational efficiency and agility helped us manage the petrochemical industry’s inherent cyclicality and position ourselves for a stronger 2025.\n",

      "\n",
      "               Within petrochemicals, chemicals markets saw mixed trends. Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) global prices fell 14%, reflecting lower oil prices. Monoethylene glycol (MEG) prices, however, rose 9%, supported by a successful market rebalancing, stronger-than-expected demand growth, and lower supply due to plant rationalizations and extended turnarounds. Methanol prices increased approximately 16%, reflecting tight supply conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "               Polymers markets were largely stable. Polyethylene global prices remained flat, constrained by continued weak demand, while polypropylene prices rose 7%, driven by limited supply and a slight improvement in demand. Polycarbonate prices remained unchanged from the previous year.\n",

(US$ 1.04 Bn.), compared to 4.40 Bn. (US$ 1.17 Bn.) in 2023. The decline was mainly due to lower margins, as global urea prices fell 5.5%, reflecting lower natural gas prices and stable demand.\n",
