## CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

### Question 1

**Q:** The parent's Retained Earnings plunged by SAR 8,059,563 (28.7%) YoY to SAR 20,056,576, while 'Other reserves' worsened by SAR 2,535,918. Simultaneously, current provisions, including Zakat payable, saw aggregate releases exceeding SAR 2.3M. Provide an LTM bridge analysis detailing how much of 2024's reported profitability was driven by these non-recurring provision reversals rather than sustainable core operations, especially as Non-Controlling Interests remained relatively robust.

**Analysis**

In 2024, SAR 690 million of the reported net income attributable to the Parent was driven by non-recurring Zakat provision reversals, rather than sustainable core operations. This represents approximately 44.8% of the Parent's total net income of SAR 1,538.5 million for the year [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62), [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=236).

An LTM (Last Twelve Months) bridge analysis detailing the drivers of the Parent's profitability from 2023 to 2024 is as follows (all amounts in thousands of Saudi Riyals):

| Item | Amount (SAR '000) | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Net Loss Attributable to Parent (2023)** | **(2,772,282)** | Starting point [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=236) |
| *Additions to Profitability:* | | |
| Lower losses from discontinued operations | +3,520,000 | Net losses from discontinued operations decreased from SAR 4.08 Bn in 2023 to SAR 0.56 Bn in 2024 [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62) |
| Improved income from operations (EBIT) | +2,020,000 | EBIT increased from SAR 3.72 Bn in 2023 to SAR 5.74 Bn in 2024, driven by higher gross profit from improved margins [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62) |
| **Non-recurring Zakat provision reversal** | **+690,000** | Decrease in Income tax and Zakat expenses from SAR 0.83 Bn in 2023 to SAR 0.14 Bn in 2024, mostly due to Zakat provision reversals [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62) |
| *Subtractions from Profitability:* | | |
| Lower fair value gains from embedded derivatives | (1,919,176) | Partially offset the improvements in profitability [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62) |
| **Net Income Attributable to Parent (2024)** | **1,538,542** | Ending point [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=236) |

**Analysis of Non-Recurring Impact on Core Operations:**
If the SAR 690 million benefit from the non-recurring Zakat provision reversal is excluded, the adjusted net income attributable to the Parent from core operations for 2024 would be approximately SAR 848.5 million (SAR 1,538.5 million - SAR 690 million). This highlights that a significant portion of the reported profitability was indeed influenced by this one-off item.

**Contextualizing Other Movements:**
*   **Retained Earnings:** The Parent's Retained Earnings did plunge by SAR 8,059,563 thousand (28.7%) YoY to SAR 20,056,576 thousand [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=174). This decline was primarily due to declared dividends of SAR 10.20 Bn in 2024, which exceeded the net income for the year [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62), [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=174).
*   **Other Reserves:** 'Other reserves' worsened by SAR 2,535,918 thousand, moving from a negative SAR 1,576,557 thousand in 2023 to a more negative SAR 4,112,475 thousand in 2024 [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=174). This was mainly due to other comprehensive losses and reclassification of re-measurement gains related to discontinued operations [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=174).
*   **Non-Controlling Interests (NCI):** NCI remained relatively robust, decreasing by only 3% from SAR 27.85 Bn in 2023 to SAR 27.09 Bn in 2024 [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62). Notably, the net income attributable to NCI in 2024 was SAR 2,184,593 thousand [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=174), which is higher than the Parent's adjusted core net income, suggesting that the underlying operational performance of the consolidated group (before NCI allocation) might be stronger than what the Parent's attributable net income alone suggests, especially after adjusting for non-recurring items.

**General PE insight:** For a private equity investor, it is crucial to normalize earnings by removing non-recurring items like provision reversals to assess the true underlying operational performance and sustainability of profitability. While the reported net income shows a significant improvement, a substantial portion is attributable to a one-off tax benefit. The decline in Retained Earnings despite positive net income points to significant dividend payouts, which should be evaluated against the company's capital allocation strategy and future growth prospects. The robust NCI suggests that certain segments or subsidiaries are performing well and contributing positively to the overall group's profitability, even if the Parent's share of core earnings is more modest after adjustments.

### Question 2

**Q:** The decline in PP&E by SAR 2,542,004 and ‘Investments in associates’ by SAR 5,801,516, coupled with a SAR 11,800,329 reduction in ‘Assets held for sale,’ raises concerns about asset stripping or underinvestment. What is the true ROIC on the *parent's* remaining capital after these disposals, and quantify the 'bow wave' of deferred CAPEX or strategic reinvestment required to sustain long-term growth and prevent future obsolescence?


![Chart](./insights_plots/plots/s1_q2.png)

**Analysis**

The provided information does not allow for a precise calculation of the "true ROIC on the *parent's* remaining capital after these disposals" nor can it quantify the 'bow wave' of deferred CAPEX or strategic reinvestment. Here's why:

1.  **Specific Disposal Figures:** The exact decline figures you provided for PP&E (SAR 2,542,004), 'Investments in associates' (SAR 5,801,516), and 'Assets held for sale' (SAR 11,800,329) are not directly verifiable as specific disposal amounts in the provided financial statements. While the report indicates a "net reduction of 2% in property, plant, and equipment" due to depreciation and amortization [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62), and an impairment of SAR 1,170 million for the investment in CLARIANT [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=204) (an associate), these do not directly match your specified figures as disposal events.

2.  **Parent's Remaining Capital:** The financial statements provided are consolidated. To calculate ROIC specifically for the *parent's* remaining capital after *these exact disposals*, a detailed parent-only balance sheet and income statement, along with the precise impact of these specific disposals on the parent's operating assets and liabilities, would be required. This level of detail is not available in the provided snippets.

### Consolidated Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for 2024
As a proxy, we can calculate the consolidated ROIC for the entity as a whole for 2024, based on available data:

*   **Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT):**
    *   Income from operations (EBIT) for 2024 was SAR 5.74 billion [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62).
    *   Income tax and Zakat expenses for 2024 amounted to SAR 0.14 billion [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62). This low figure is partly due to the reversal of Zakat provisions [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62).
    *   Effective Tax Rate = SAR 0.14 Bn / SAR 5.74 Bn = 2.44%
    *   NOPAT = SAR 5.74 Bn * (1 - 0.0244) = SAR 5.60 billion.

*   **Invested Capital (Approximation):**
    *   Total assets at year-end 2024 were SAR 278.02 billion [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62). We use total assets as a simplified proxy for invested capital, assuming most assets are operating assets and are financed by a mix of debt and equity.

*   **Consolidated ROIC (2024):**
    *   SAR 5.60 billion (NOPAT) / SAR 278.02 billion (Invested Capital) = **2.01%**

This consolidated ROIC of 2.01% reflects the overall operational efficiency of the entity's capital employed in 2024. However, it does not specifically account for the parent's capital after the precise disposals you mentioned.

### 'Bow Wave' of Deferred CAPEX or Strategic Reinvestment
The provided retrieval results do not contain any information or forward-looking statements that would allow for the quantification of a 'bow wave' of deferred CAPEX or strategic reinvestment required to sustain long-term growth and prevent future obsolescence. This would typically involve detailed capital expenditure plans, asset age profiles, or strategic investment outlooks, which are not present in the given snippets.

### Question 3

**Q:** Cash and cash equivalents declined by SAR 1,875,328 to SAR 30,539,668, yet 'Other current liabilities' surged by SAR 1,497,650 YoY to SAR 19,695,999, almost equaling Trade Payables. Detail the specific composition and unsecured nature of this shadow financing. What is the working capital intensity and the immediate liquidity impact if this 'other' liability, now representing 43.4% of total current liabilities (excluding assets held for sale), were to be abruptly called?


![Chart](./insights_plots/plots/s1_q3.png)

**Analysis**

Based on the provided information, cash and cash equivalents for the entity stood at SAR 30,539,668 as of December 31, 2024 [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=215). While your query highlights a surge in 'Other current liabilities' to SAR 19,695,999, the provided documents do not offer a detailed breakdown of the specific composition or the unsecured nature of this particular liability for the main entity. The term "shadow financing" is not used in the provided financial excerpts, and there is no information to determine if this liability is unsecured.

Regarding **working capital intensity**, the necessary comprehensive financial statements (specifically a full balance sheet detailing all current assets and current liabilities) for the main entity are not available in the provided retrieval results. Therefore, a precise calculation of working capital intensity cannot be performed. The documents do mention a "reduction in working capital in 2023, mostly due to inventory management efforts" [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=63), but this is a general statement and not sufficient for a quantitative analysis of intensity.

Concerning the **immediate liquidity impact if this 'other' liability were to be abruptly called**:

*   **Current Liquidity Position:** The company holds SAR 30,539,668 in cash and cash equivalents [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=215).
*   **Potential Impact:** If the 'Other current liabilities' amounting to SAR 19,695,999 were to be abruptly called, it would represent a significant immediate cash outflow. Comparing this to the available cash and cash equivalents, the company would still have a buffer of approximately SAR 10.84 million (SAR 30.54 million - SAR 19.70 million). However, this assumes all cash and cash equivalents are readily available and not earmarked for other purposes (e.g., unclaimed dividends, as noted for SAR 1,126 million in 2024 [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=215)).

**General PE insight:** An abrupt call of a liability of this magnitude, representing 43.4% of total current liabilities (as stated in your query), would place considerable strain on the company's liquidity. Even with a positive cash balance remaining, it could necessitate drawing down credit lines, liquidating other short-term investments, or potentially disrupting operational cash flows. The actual impact would heavily depend on the specific terms of this liability, its maturity profile, any associated covenants, and the company's access to additional short-term funding.

To provide a more comprehensive analysis, additional information would be required, including:

*   A detailed breakdown of the 'Other current liabilities' account.
*   The terms and conditions of these liabilities (e.g., maturity dates, interest rates, collateral, covenants).
*   A complete balance sheet for the main entity to assess total current assets and liabilities accurately.
*   Information on available undrawn credit facilities or other sources of short-term liquidity.

### Question 4

**Q:** The SAR 2,535,918 negative swing in 'Other reserves' indicates significant currency translation losses or revaluation impacts. Given the current Debt (non-current and current) stands at SAR 28,188,082 for 2024, provide a stress-tested LTM Debt-to-Equity ratio under a 5-10% SAR de-pegging scenario. How robust are the existing derivative instruments (SAR 3,669,688 asset vs. SAR 1,975,894 non-current liability) in fully hedging this systemic FX risk?


![Chart](./insights_plots/plots/s1_q4.png)

**Analysis**

The SAR 2,535,918 negative swing in 'Other reserves' for 2024 primarily reflects significant foreign currency translation losses, with the 'Foreign currency translation' component of other reserves moving from (SAR 3,750,814) at January 1, 2024, to (SAR 5,844,206) at December 31, 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217). This existing loss is already factored into the 2024 equity.

To provide a stress-tested LTM Debt-to-Equity ratio under a 5-10% SAR de-pegging scenario, we first establish the baseline:

**1. Baseline LTM Debt-to-Equity Ratio (2024):**
*   **Debt (non-current and current):** SAR 28,188,082 thousand (as provided in the query)
*   **Total Equity (as at 31 December 2024):** SAR 183,918,159 thousand [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=246)

**Baseline Debt-to-Equity Ratio =** SAR 28,188,082 / SAR 183,918,159 = **0.15x**

**2. Stress-Tested LTM Debt-to-Equity Ratio under SAR De-pegging:**
Assuming a systemic de-pegging of the SAR would lead to a depreciation against major foreign currencies (e.g., USD), and conservatively assuming the entire debt is exposed to this FX risk, the debt in SAR terms would increase. The impact on equity from further foreign currency translation losses is difficult to quantify precisely without a detailed breakdown of net foreign currency assets and liabilities, but the existing negative swing in 'Other reserves' highlights the sensitivity.

| Scenario | Impact on Debt | New Debt (SAR '000) | Equity (SAR '000) | Stress-Tested D/E Ratio |
| :------- | :------------- | :------------------ | :----------------- | :---------------------- |
| **5% SAR Depreciation** | Debt increases by 5% | 28,188,082 * 1.05 = 29,597,486 | 183,918,159 | **0.16x** |
| **10% SAR Depreciation** | Debt increases by 10% | 28,188,082 * 1.10 = 31,006,890 | 183,918,159 | **0.17x** |

Under these stress scenarios, the Debt-to-Equity ratio would increase from 0.15x to approximately 0.16x (5% depreciation) or 0.17x (10% depreciation).

**3. Robustness of Existing Derivative Instruments:**
The existing derivative instruments (SAR 3,669,688 asset vs. SAR 1,975,894 non-current liability) are unlikely to fully hedge a systemic SAR de-pegging scenario. The company's financial risk management explicitly states, "There is no exposure of Saudi Riyal to USD, as the Saudi Riyal is pegged to the USD" [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=245). This indicates that the current hedging strategy does not account for a break in the SAR-USD peg, as this risk is not considered an exposure under normal operating assumptions. Therefore, any derivatives in place are likely designed to manage other market risks or foreign currency exposures against non-USD currencies, rather than a systemic FX risk involving the SAR-USD peg. The 'Cash flow hedge' component of 'Other reserves' is only SAR 7,109 thousand as at 31 December 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217), suggesting limited hedging specifically for cash flow FX risk.

**General PE insight:** A systemic de-pegging event represents a significant shift in macroeconomic policy, which typically falls outside the scope of standard corporate hedging strategies focused on operational currency exposures. Such an event would likely have broader implications beyond just the revaluation of debt and could impact revenue, costs, and overall economic stability, which are not captured solely by derivative instruments.

### Question 5

**Q:** The massive SAR 11,800,329 reduction in 'Assets held for sale,' fully clearing its associated liabilities, indicates a significant disposal. Beyond any immediate cash inflow, what was the precise P&L impact (gain/loss) of this transaction, and what proportion of 2024's purported Free Cash Flow conversion is directly attributable to such one-off asset sales versus genuine, sustainable operational cash generation?


![Chart](./insights_plots/plots/s1_q5.png)

**Analysis**

The specific SAR 11,800,329 reduction in 'Assets held for sale' cannot be precisely identified as a single transaction or a direct calculation from the provided documents. However, based on the identified asset disposals and re-measurements in 2024, the P&L impact and the proportion of cash generation can be determined.

### P&L Impact of Identified Asset Disposals and Re-measurements in 2024
For the year ended 31 December 2024, the combined P&L impact from significant asset disposals and re-measurements is a **net loss of SAR 3,144,812 thousand**:

*   **Loss on sale of Hadeed**: SAR (3,235,171) thousand [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). This loss includes a fair value re-measurement loss of SAR 304,129 thousand recorded during 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239), [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=238).
*   **Gain on sale of Film & Sheet (F&S) business**: SAR 291,359 thousand [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=240), [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=231).
*   **Fair value re-measurement loss on ALBA shares**: SAR (201,000) thousand [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). This loss was recorded under results from associates and non-integral joint ventures.

### Proportion of 2024's Cash Generation
Assuming 'Free Cash Flow conversion' refers to the total cash generated from operating activities and one-off asset sales, the proportions are as follows:

*   **Genuine, sustainable operational cash generation**: The net cash generated from operating activities for the group in 2024 was **SAR 16,358,596 thousand** [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=175).
*   **Cash directly attributable to one-off asset sales**: The cash consideration received from asset sales in 2024 includes:
    *   Hadeed sale: SAR 1,163,045 thousand [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239).
    *   F&S business sale: SAR 562,424 thousand [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=240).
    *   Total cash from one-off asset sales: **SAR 1,725,469 thousand**.

Combining these, the total cash generated for this analysis is SAR 16,358,596 thousand (operating) + SAR 1,725,469 thousand (asset sales) = SAR 18,084,065 thousand.

Therefore, the proportion of 2024's cash generation directly attributable to:
*   **One-off asset sales**: Approximately **9.54%** (SAR 1,725,469 thousand / SAR 18,084,065 thousand).
*   **Genuine, sustainable operational cash generation**: Approximately **90.46%** (SAR 16,358,596 thousand / SAR 18,084,065 thousand).

**General PE insight**: While asset sales can provide significant cash injections, a high proportion of cash flow from sustainable operational activities is generally preferred as it indicates the core business's health and recurring profitability. One-off sales, while potentially strategic for portfolio optimization, do not contribute to long-term sustainable cash generation.
