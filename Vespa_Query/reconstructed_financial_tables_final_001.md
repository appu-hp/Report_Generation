## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The table below illustrates the approximate impact on the DBO if the Group were to change one key assumption, while the other actuarial assumptions remain unchanged. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of the DBO under market conditions at the measurement date. These results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in key actuarial assumptions may have on the total DBO. The sensitivities only apply to the DBO and not to the net amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. Movements in the fair value of plan assets would, to a certain extent, be expected to offset movements in the DBO resulting from changes in the given assumptions.
