# Internal Research Report (Before Critique)

## Research Section: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION
### Q: What were the primary drivers for the 5.6% decrease in total assets from 2023 to 2024?
**Internal Result:** The total assets decreased by 6% from 2023 to 2024, from dfc294.38 billion to dfc278.02 billion [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=62). The primary drivers for this reduction were:

*   **Sale of Hadeed**: The sale of Saudi Iron and Steel Company (Hadeed) and its subsequent removal from assets held for sale was a major contributor to the decrease [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=62), [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=238).
*   **Reduction in Property, Plant, and Equipment**: A net reduction of 2% in property, plant, and equipment also contributed, primarily due to regular depreciation and amortization [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=62).

### Q: Can you provide a detailed breakdown and explanation for the 14.2% decrease in Investments in associates and joint ventures, including any disposals, impairments, or changes in equity method accounting?
**Internal Result:** The 14.2% decrease in Investments in associates and joint ventures is primarily attributable to significant impairments and disposals, alongside the ongoing adjustments from equity method accounting. Key factors contributing to this decrease include:B1.  **Impairment of Investment in CLARIANT A.G.**B2.  A substantial impairment of SAR 1,170 million was recognized during 2024 (compared to SAR 368 million in 2023) for the investment in CLARIANT A.G. This was triggered by a decline in CLARIANT's share price from CHF 12.42 as of December 31, 2023, to CHF 10.09 as of December 31, 2024, mainly due to global market challenges. This impairment was recorded within the 'share of results of non-integral joint ventures and associates' [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=204). The carrying amount of the investment in CLARIANT decreased from SAR 7,520 million in 2023 to SAR 5,688 million in 2024 [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=204).B3.  **Disposal of Shares in Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. (ALBA)**B4.  In September 2024, SABIC announced an agreement to sell its 20.62% holding in ALBA. This investment was subsequently classified as 'assets held for sale' and resulted in a fair value remeasurement loss of SAR 201 million, which was recognized under 'results from associates and non-integral joint ventures' [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239).B5.  **Equity Method Accounting Adjustments**B6.  Under the equity method, the carrying amount of investments in associates and joint ventures is adjusted for the Group's share of post-acquisition results and movements in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=183). Dividends received from these entities also reduce the investment's carrying amount [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=183).B7.  *   **Share of Results**: While 'results of associates and non-integral joint ventures' showed a positive contribution of SAR 434,634 thousand in 2024 (SAR 208,457 thousand in 2023), 'results of integral joint ventures' represented a loss of SAR 765,158 thousand in 2024 (SAR 931,459 thousand in 2023) [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=175). Losses reduce the investment's carrying value.B8.  *   **Dividends Received**: Dividends received from integral joint ventures amounted to SAR 1,787,474 thousand in both 2024 and 2023, which directly reduces the carrying value of the investments [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=175), [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=183).B9.  **Offsetting Factor (Acquisition)**B10. It is worth noting that there was an acquisition of a 49% shareholding in ETG Inputs Holdco Limited (EIHL) in April 2023, recognized as a joint venture under the equity method [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=204). However, the net effect of the aforementioned impairments, disposals, and equity method adjustments resulted in an overall decrease in the investment balance.

### Q: What is the nature of the significant increase in Deferred tax assets (35.2%)? What is the likelihood and timing of their realization?
**Internal Result:** Deferred tax assets (DTAs) arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, as well as from deductible temporary differences, tax credits, and tax losses carried forward [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=184), [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=180). These are classified as non-current assets [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=184).

The provided information does not explicitly detail a 35.2% increase in *recognized* Deferred Tax Assets. However, the Group reported an increase in *unrecognized* tax losses carry forward from 42,699 million Saudi Riyals in 2023 to 52,475 million Saudi Riyals in 2024, representing an increase of approximately 22.89% [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=236). These unrecognised tax losses are primarily in Luxembourg, Netherlands, and the United States of America and can be applied against future taxable income [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=236).

**Likelihood and Timing of Realization:**

*   **Significant Judgement:** Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=180).
*   **Probability Forecasts:** The Group prepares analyses of probability forecasts for future years, which include scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=180).
*   **Business Plan Adherence:** Recoverability is contingent on the Group's ability to adhere to its business plan [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=180).
*   **Annual Review:** The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced if it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=185).
*   **Tax Rates:** Deferred tax assets are measured at the tax rates expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized, based on enacted or substantively enacted tax laws at the reporting date [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=184).
*   **Pending Filings:** In certain jurisdictions, the utilization of tax losses is pending the completion of tax filings and/or acceptance by tax authorities [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=236).

### Q: Please explain the components of the 33.4% increase in 'Other assets and receivables' within non-current assets.
**Internal Result:** The 33.4% increase in 'Other assets and receivables' within non-current assets, from 6,011,266 thousand Saudi Riyals in 2023 to 8,020,234 thousand Saudi Riyals in 2024 [4], is primarily driven by the long-term portion of receivables from the sale of Saudi Iron and Steel Company ("Hadeed") to the Public Investment Fund ("PIF").

Following the completion of the Hadeed sale by May 31, 2024, the Group recognized "Long-term and current receivables" from PIF amounting to 4,826,091 thousand Saudi Riyals [1]. These receivables are scheduled to be received over the next two years and are classified as a 'financial asset at amortised cost' [1]. The portion of these receivables due beyond one year would be categorized under non-current 'Other assets and receivables', thus contributing significantly to the observed increase in this balance sheet line item for 2024.

While this is the most significant identifiable component, a detailed breakdown of all elements comprising 'Other assets and receivables' (typically found in Note 14 of the financial statements) is not available in the provided documents.

### Q: The 'Other assets and receivables' under current assets increased by 94.5% year-over-year. What specific items contribute to this substantial increase, and what is their collectibility and liquidity profile?
**Internal Result:** The substantial year-over-year increase in 'Other assets and receivables' under current assets is primarily driven by significant items related to discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale. The key contributing items and their collectibility and liquidity profiles are as follows:

*   **Receivables from Public Investment Fund (PIF):** Following the sale of SABIC's shares in the Saudi Iron and Steel Company ("Hadeed") to PIF, the Group recognized long-term and current receivables amounting to approximately 4,826,091 thousand Saudi Riyals [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). These receivables are to be collected within the next two years and are classified as a 'financial asset at amortised cost' [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). Given that PIF is a sovereign wealth fund, the **collectibility** of these receivables is considered high. The portion due within one year contributes to current assets, indicating a **liquidity profile** that is partially short-term and partially medium-term.

*   **Other assets of Hadeed Disposal Group:** The 'Other assets' within the Hadeed disposal group, which was classified as a discontinued operation, increased significantly from 2,036,146 thousand Saudi Riyals as at 31 December 2023 to 9,436,438 thousand Saudi Riyals as at 31 May 2024 (the date of disposal) [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). These assets were presented as 'held for sale' under IFRS 5, meaning they were expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than continuing use, with the sale highly probable within twelve months [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=238). This classification implies a high **liquidity profile** within the short term, contingent on the successful completion of the sale. The **collectibility** is tied to the sale proceeds.

*   **Sale of Shares in Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. ("ALBA"):** The Group announced an agreement for the sale of its 20.62% holding in ALBA, with sale proceeds of approximately 3,624,000 thousand Saudi Riyals [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). This investment has been classified as 'assets held for sale' because the sale is highly probable within twelve months [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). Similar to Hadeed's assets, this classification indicates a high **liquidity profile** in the short term, subject to customary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of conditions precedent [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). The **collectibility** is dependent on the successful closing of the transaction.

**General PE insight:** The reclassification of assets as 'held for sale' and the recognition of significant receivables from divestitures are common drivers for increases in 'Other assets and receivables' in financial statements. For assets held for sale, their valuation is typically at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, which helps manage potential collectibility risks by reflecting current market expectations [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=238), [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239). Financial assets at amortised cost, such as the PIF receivable, are subject to impairment assessments for Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=187), [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=188).


### Q: Can you elaborate on the significant reduction (76.5%) in 'Assets held for sale'? What assets were disposed of, at what value, and what was the gain or loss recognized?
**Internal Result:** The significant reduction in 'Assets held for sale' primarily resulted from the disposal of two major assets: the Saudi Iron and Steel Company ("Hadeed") and the Film & Sheet (F&S) business. All amounts are in thousands of Saudi Riyals unless otherwise stated [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239), [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=240).

### 1. Disposal of Saudi Iron and Steel Company ("Hadeed")

SABIC completed the transfer of ownership of Hadeed to the Public Investment Fund (PIF) on May 31, 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239), [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=238).

*   **Value at Disposal:** The total sale consideration received or receivable for Hadeed was 5,989,136, consisting of 1,163,045 in cash and 4,826,091 in long-term and current receivables [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239).
*   **Gain or Loss Recognized:** A loss on the sale of Hadeed of 3,235,171 was recognized. This loss included a fair value re-measurement loss of 304,129 recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239), [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=238).

### 2. Disposal of Film & Sheet (F&S) Business

SABIC satisfied all customary conditions and obtained regulatory approvals for the sale of the F&S business on September 1, 2024 [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=240).

*   **Assets Disposed:** The carrying amounts of assets of the F&S business at the date of disposal were:
    *   Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets: 432,937 [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=240)

### 3. Other Assets Held for Sale

Additionally, on September 17, 2024, SABIC announced the signing of an agreement for the sale of its 20.62% holding in Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. ("ALBA") to Saudi Arabian Mining Company ("Ma'aden"). This investment was classified as 'assets held for sale' as of December 31, 2024, with expected sale proceeds of approximately 3,624,000. A fair value remeasurement loss of 201,000 was recorded. However, the completion of this transaction was still subject to customary regulatory approvals and conditions precedent as of December 31, 2024, meaning it had not yet been disposed of [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239).

### Q: What factors contributed to the 40.5% increase in non-current debt? Please provide details on the new debt facilities, their terms, interest rates, and covenants.
**Internal Result:** The provided documents do not contain information detailing a 40.5% increase in non-current debt. While there is a mention of an increase in committed credit facilities from ▲ 11,625 million in 2023 to ▲ 22,875 million in 2024, this refers to undrawn borrowing facilities and not necessarily an increase in drawn non-current debt [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=223). The non-current lease liabilities, which are a component of non-current liabilities, actually decreased from 4,622,459 in 2023 to 3,983,960 in 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=223).

Furthermore, the documents do not provide details on new debt facilities, their specific terms, interest rates, or covenants. To understand the factors contributing to the 40.5% increase in non-current debt, if such an increase occurred, and to obtain details on new debt facilities, additional financial statements or notes specifically addressing long-term borrowings would be required.

### Q: What caused the significant decrease in 'Other reserves' from (1,576,557) to (4,112,475)?
**Internal Result:** The significant decrease in 'Other reserves' from (1,576,557) to (4,112,475) was primarily driven by several factors during the year ended 31 December 2024 [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217). The total decrease amounted to (2,535,918) [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217). The main contributing factors to this decrease were:

*   **Exchange difference on translation:** A negative impact of (1,255,981) [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217).
*   **Share of other comprehensive loss of associates and joint ventures:** A loss of (984,366) [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217).
*   **Reclassification of re-measurement gain on defined benefit plans related to discontinued operation:** A decrease of (601,895) [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217).
*   **Net change on revaluation of investments in equity instruments classified as FVOCI:** A decrease of (19,297) [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217).

These negative movements were partially offset by a **re-measurement gain on defined benefit plans, net of tax**, which contributed 325,621 to the reserves [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=217).

### Q: Please explain the reduction in Retained earnings by 28.6%. Was this due to lower profitability, significant dividend distributions, or other comprehensive income adjustments?
**Internal Result:** Based on the provided documents, a 28.6% reduction in Retained Earnings cannot be directly confirmed. However, the documents indicate a 6% decrease in **Equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent**, from SAR 167.43 billion in 2023 to SAR 156.83 billion in 2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=62).

This decline in equity was **mainly due to declared dividends of SAR 10.20 billion** [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=62). Dividends are typically appropriated from retained earnings [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=216).

Regarding your other points:

*   **Lower profitability**: The company actually experienced improved profitability in 2024, reporting a net income attributable to equity holders of the Parent of SAR 1.54 billion, compared to a net loss of SAR 2.77 billion in 2023 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=62), [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=236). This improvement would generally increase retained earnings, not decrease them.
*   **Other comprehensive income adjustments**: While other comprehensive income (OCI) adjustments are mentioned in the context of investments and discontinued operations, the provided information does not offer specific figures or a direct link to a significant reduction in retained earnings [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=238), [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=184).

**General PE insight**: Retained earnings are impacted by net income (or loss), dividend distributions, and certain other comprehensive income adjustments. A significant reduction typically points to either substantial losses or large dividend payouts that exceed current period profits.

### Q: What is the composition of the 5.2% increase in Employee benefits? Are these primarily post-employment benefits, and what are the key actuarial assumptions used?
**Internal Result:** The total provision for employee benefits increased by approximately 4.75% from SAR 12,894,392 thousand in 2023 to SAR 13,507,010 thousand in 2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=223). The specific 5.2% increase mentioned in your query is not explicitly detailed in the provided information; however, the overall increase is primarily driven by post-employment benefits.

**Composition of the Increase in Employee Benefits (2023 to 2024):**
The increase in employee benefits is primarily composed of the following changes [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=223):

*   **End of service benefits:** Increased by SAR 414,508 thousand (from SAR 10,613,240 thousand to SAR 11,027,748 thousand).
*   **Post-retirement medical benefits:** Increased by SAR 240,601 thousand (from SAR 881,699 thousand to SAR 1,122,300 thousand).
*   **Long-term service awards:** Increased by SAR 3,086 thousand (from SAR 63,990 thousand to SAR 67,076 thousand).
*   **Defined benefits pension schemes:** Decreased by SAR 37,317 thousand (from SAR 1,287,037 thousand to SAR 1,249,720 thousand).
*   **Early retirement plans:** Decreased by SAR 8,260 thousand (from SAR 48,426 thousand to SAR 40,166 thousand).

**Primary Nature of Benefits:**
Yes, these benefits are primarily post-employment benefits. Defined benefit obligations, which include end of service benefits, defined benefit pension schemes, and post-retirement medical benefits, constitute approximately 99.2% of the total employee benefits in 2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=223).

**Key Actuarial Assumptions Used (for the year ended 31 December 2024):**
The major economic and actuarial assumptions used in benefits liabilities computation vary by region [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=228):

| Assumption | KSA | USA | UK |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Discount rate | 5.60% | 5.45% | 5.55% |
| Average salary increase | Exec: 4.50% Non-Exec: 6.00% | - | - |
| Pension in payment increase | N/A | N/A | 2.95% |
| Inflation rate (health care cost) | 9% in 2025 & 8% thereafter | N/A | N/A |
| Duration of benefits plan | 11 years | 11 years | 15 years |

Actuarial valuations are performed periodically by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) is determined by discounting estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds, or government bonds where a deep market for corporate bonds does not exist [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=191).

### Q: Can you explain the substantial decrease of 88.3% in current Provisions? What specific provisions were reversed or utilized?
**Internal Result:** The substantial decrease of 88.3% in current provisions, from SAR 1,175,952 thousand in 2023 to SAR 137,248 thousand in 2024, was primarily driven by significant utilization and reversals across various provision categories [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=230).

The most significant contributors to this decrease were:

*   **Miscellaneous provisions**: These decreased by SAR 874,293 thousand, from SAR 947,921 thousand in 2023 to SAR 73,628 thousand in 2024. This category saw total utilization of SAR 881,117 thousand and reversals of SAR 86,543 thousand in 2024. These provisions were largely related to various risks and commitments, including unavoidable obligations from a construction project, which were mostly provided for in 2023 to be settled in 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=230).
*   **Restructuring provisions**: These decreased by SAR 133,717 thousand, from SAR 184,395 thousand in 2023 to SAR 50,678 thousand in 2024. This category experienced total utilization of SAR 312,473 thousand in 2024, covering onerous contracts, termination benefits, and severance costs related to specific restructuring projects [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=230).

Other provisions that contributed to the overall reduction in current provisions through utilization and reversals include:

*   **Demolition and site restoration**: Current provisions decreased by SAR 27,936 thousand. Total utilization for this category was SAR 122,281 thousand, and reversals amounted to SAR 126,327 thousand in 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=230).
*   **Environmental obligations**: Current provisions decreased by SAR 2,758 thousand. Total utilization for this category was SAR 10,852 thousand, and reversals amounted to SAR 255,764 thousand in 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=230).

In summary, the significant decrease in current provisions is primarily attributable to the settlement and reversal of previously recognized obligations, particularly within miscellaneous and restructuring categories, as these liabilities matured or were re-evaluated during 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=230).

### Q: What led to the significant decrease of 91.6% in Zakat payable? Does this reflect lower taxable income or a settlement of prior year's obligations?
**Internal Result:** The significant decrease of 91.6% in Zakat payable, from SAR 1,414,718 thousand at December 31, 2023, to SAR 118,339 thousand at December 31, 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=233), was primarily driven by a reassessment of Zakat positions for both current and previous years [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=233). This reassessment followed the publication of new Zakat regulations during 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=233). Consequently, the company reversed Zakat provisions in 2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=62).

While the company did make Zakat and income tax payments during the year [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=175), the substantial reduction in the payable balance is mainly attributable to these regulatory changes and the subsequent adjustment of recognized liabilities, rather than solely lower taxable income or a routine settlement of prior year's obligations. The Zakat expense itself decreased significantly from SAR 1,269 million in 2023 to SAR 214 million in 2024 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=233), contributing to the lower payable.

### Q: What is the overall debt maturity profile, and what are the company's plans for managing refinancing risk and interest rate exposure?
**Internal Result:** The company's debt maturity profile as of December 31, 2024, for debt (excluding lease liabilities) is as follows [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=244):

*   **Within 1 year:** 1,768,422 thousand Saudi Riyals
*   **Between 1-2 years:** 3,761,221 thousand Saudi Riyals
*   **Between 2-5 years:** 14,414,977 thousand Saudi Riyals
*   **More than 5 years:** 8,110,000 thousand Saudi Riyals
*   **Total Debt:** 28,054,620 thousand Saudi Riyals

### Managing Refinancing Risk (Liquidity Risk)
The company manages liquidity risk, which encompasses refinancing risk, by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and adequate banking facilities [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=244). Key strategies include [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=244):

*   Setting an appropriate liquidity framework.
*   Monitoring cash flow forecasts to ensure overall liquidity.
*   Maintaining a sufficient portfolio of easily liquidatable assets.
*   Utilizing global cash pooling mechanisms.
*   Investing surplus funds in current accounts, fixed term deposits, money market deposits, and marketable securities, prioritizing security and liquidity over yield.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the group had significant undrawn committed credit facilities amounting to 12,585 million Saudi Riyals, providing a buffer for potential refinancing needs [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=223).

### Managing Interest Rate Exposure
The company's exposure to interest rate risk primarily stems from its long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=245). To manage this exposure, the company [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=245):

*   Maintains a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. As of December 31, 2024, variable rate borrowings totaled 22,337 million Saudi Riyals, and fixed rate borrowings were 7,928 million Saudi Riyals [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=245).
*   May enter into simple financial derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to lower volatility and increase the predictability of interest expenses. However, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding during the years ended 2023 and 2022 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=245).

### Q: What is the working capital management strategy, particularly concerning the changes in inventories, trade receivables, other current assets, and trade payables?
**Internal Result:** The working capital management strategy, particularly concerning inventories, trade receivables, other current assets, and trade payables, is primarily defined by specific accounting policies and risk management approaches for each component:

*   **Inventories:** Inventories, including raw materials, work in progress, finished goods, consumables, and spare parts, are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average principle, including directly attributable costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Work in progress and finished goods costs incorporate materials, labor, and a proportionate share of direct overheads [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=189).

*   **Trade Receivables:**
    *   **Measurement:** Trade receivables with provisional pricing clauses are measured at fair value, while others that meet the 'Solely Payments of Principal and Interest' (SPPI) criteria are measured at amortised cost [5](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=187).
    *   **Impairment (ECLs):** A simplified approach is used for calculating Expected Credit Losses (ECLs), recognizing a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. This involves a provision matrix derived from historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to debtors and the economic environment [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=188).
    *   **Currency Risk:** Currency exchange risks associated with account receivables are centrally managed at the Group level using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodology [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=245).

*   **Other Current Assets:** The provided information mentions "Other non-current and current assets" in the context of assets classified as held for sale [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=239), but does not detail a general management strategy for these assets within ongoing working capital.

*   **Trade Payables:** These represent unsecured liabilities for goods and services received prior to the financial period end that remain unpaid. They are typically settled within 30 to 60 days of recognition. Trade payables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=188).
    *   **Currency Risk:** Similar to receivables, currency exchange risks from account payables are centrally managed using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodology [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=245).

**General PE insight:** While specific policies for individual working capital components are detailed, the documents do not explicitly outline a holistic working capital management strategy. However, the company's overall strategic levers include maintaining a robust, efficient balance sheet to navigate the cyclical nature of its industry, which implicitly covers effective working capital management [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=30).

### Q: Are there any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, contingent liabilities, or guarantees that are not reflected in this statement but are detailed in the accompanying notes?
**Internal Result:** Yes, the accompanying notes detail significant off-balance sheet arrangements in the form of commitments, as well as contingent liabilities and specific information regarding guarantees.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Commitments)**
The Group has several significant commitments that are detailed in the notes:
*   **Capital Expenditures**: As of 31 December 2024, the Group had commitments of ▲ 715 million (31 December 2023: ▲ 9,238 million) related to capital expenditures [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=246).
*   **Equity Contribution Commitments**:

    *   **NUSANED Fund II**: Outstanding commitments of ▲ 13.6 million and ▲ 431 million respectively (31 December 2023: ▲ 13.6 million and ▲ 446 million respectively) towards its 50% interest in NUSANED Fund II [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=246).
    *   **SABIC Fujian Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. ('FUJIAN')**: An outstanding equity commitment of ▲ 2,826 million as of 31 December 2024, for a world-scale Petrochemical complex in China, where construction began in the first half of 2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=246).

**Contingent Liabilities**
*   **Legal Claims**: SABIC has a number of legal claims in the ordinary course of business. Management, based on legal advice, believes these claims will not have a significant adverse impact on the financial position or future results, beyond amounts already accrued for [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=246).
*   **Bank Guarantees**: The Group's bankers have issued bank guarantees on its behalf, amounting to ▲ 1,150 million as of 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: ▲ 1,263 million). These are mainly related to its integral joint ventures [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=246).

**Guarantees**
*   **Financial Guarantee Contracts Issued by SABIC**: There were no outstanding financial guarantees issued by SABIC as of 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: ▲ nil) [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=246). Financial guarantee contracts, when issued, are recognized as a financial liability at fair value [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=189).
*   **Related Party Guarantees**: No guarantees were provided or received for any related party receivables or payables [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic-integrated-annual-report-2024-en_tcm1010-46870.pdf#page=237).
