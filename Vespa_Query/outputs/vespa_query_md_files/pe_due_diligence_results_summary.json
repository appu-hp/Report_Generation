The retrieval results discuss SABIC's strategic portfolio optimization, including the divestment of non-core assets such as Hadeed (steel) and its stake in Aluminium Bahrain (Alba), as well as a significant impairment charge on Clariant AG of SAR 1,170 million [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=204), [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=204), [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,20,36,240,248).

                    "response": "The observed decrease in Property, Plant & Equipment by SAR 2,542,004 and Intangible assets by SAR 601,376 in FY 2024 is consistent with the company's strategic pivot involving significant divestments. In FY 2024, the company was actively optimizing its portfolio by divesting non-core assets such as Hadeed (steel) and its 20.62% stake in Aluminium Bahrain (Alba) [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=5,30,63), [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,34), [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,20,36,240,248). This disciplined divestment strategy aims to sharpen the focus on core petrochemicals and fund high-growth projects [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,34), [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,34).\n\nHowever, a comprehensive LTM analysis of capital expenditures (CAPEX) versus depreciation/amortization to demonstrate the sufficiency of the current run-rate is not fully possible with the provided information. While the retrieval results indicate a CAPEX of SAR 17,690 million for FY 2022 [6](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=38), there is no specific LTM or FY 2024 CAPEX figure, nor are there any depreciation or amortization figures for a comparable period in the provided documents.\n\nGeneral PE insight suggests that a decrease in gross fixed assets due to disposals, coupled with new strategic investments, can indicate a portfolio rebalancing rather than pure asset harvesting. The company is redirecting capital towards significant future growth projects, such as the SAR 24 billion Fujian Petrochemical Complex in China, expected to be completed in 2026, and the world's largest MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia, with mechanical completion in 2025 [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,35,70,247). These forward-looking investments suggest an intent to upgrade and expand, rather than solely harvest, existing assets.\n\nTo perform a complete LTM CAPEX versus depreciation/amortization analysis, specific LTM or FY 2024 figures for both capital expenditures and depreciation/amortization would be required.",

                    "response": "The provided documents do not contain the specific figures for a decline in Cash and Cash Equivalents to SAR 30,539,668 or an increase in \"Other liabilities\" to SAR 19,695,999. The financial data available primarily discusses balances in billions of SAR, while your query refers to figures in millions, suggesting a potential discrepancy in the scope or entity being referenced. Therefore, I cannot directly clarify the nature of these specific balance sheet movements or precisely justify how SAR 45,381,288 in current liabilities would be met based on these exact figures from the provided sources.Additional granular balance sheet details would be required to address these specific figures.\n\nHowever, I can offer general insights based on available information regarding the company's overall financial health and funding strategies:\n\nRegarding the nature of \"shadow financing,\" the closest relevant information is a significant rise in gross debt for FY2024, which increased to SAR 35.20 billion from SAR 33.50 billion in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a substantial rise in related-party borrowings from a Saudi Aramco subsidiary, reaching SAR 7.40 billion [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=65,221,237). While related-party transactions are common, their significant increase as a funding source warrants careful scrutiny to understand terms and implications, which aligns with the concern about \"shadow financing.\" Given Saudi Aramco is the majority shareholder [9](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=17,19,210), these borrowings represent internal group funding rather than traditional market-based debt.\n\nTo address the broader concern of meeting current liabilities and working capital intensity, the company demonstrates the following financial strengths and strategies:\n\n*   **Strong Balance Sheet & Liquidity:** The company maintained a net cash position of SAR 3.01 billion in FY2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=13,15,21,65,246) and holds top-tier credit ratings of A+/A1 (standalone) and Aa3 (Moody's) [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=5,13,21,64), [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=5,13,21,64). These indicators suggest significant financial flexibility and resilience to manage its obligations.\n*   **Operating Cash Flow:** While Net Cash from Operating Activities decreased by 33% to SAR 16.36 billion in FY2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=64) and Free Cash Flow declined by 56% to SAR 6.16 billion [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,61,64), the company still generates substantial cash from its core operations. For FY2022, Net Cash from Operating Activities was SAR 27.71 billion [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=190).\n*   **Portfolio Optimization and Divestments:** The company is actively divesting non-core assets, such as Hadeed (steel) and its stake in Alba (aluminum), to focus on core petrochemicals [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin%2Fsabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf), [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,20,36,240,248). These divestments generate capital that can be used to strengthen liquidity and fund strategic growth projects, thereby indirectly supporting the ability to meet liabilities.\n*   **Aramco Synergy:** The strategic partnership with Saudi Aramco delivered US$ 0.81 billion in value in 2024, with cumulative synergies reaching US$ 2.57 billion since June 2020 [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,34). This ongoing synergy provides a consistent source of value creation.\n\nWhile the company faces challenges such as declining profitability and FCF, its robust balance sheet, access to funding through related-party borrowings, and strategic asset divestments indicate a strong capacity to manage its financial obligations. The documents do not provide details on specific reliance on unsecured trade credit.",

Demonstrate how this would impact debt serviceability and access to capital given the current liquidity profile.",
                "rag_summary": {
                    "response": "I cannot perform the precise numerical stress-test for the LTM Debt-to-Equity ratio using the specific debt figures (SAR 27,970,946 to SAR 30,269,004) and \"Other reserves\" shift (SAR 2,535,918) you provided. The retrieval results exclusively contain financial data for SABIC, a company whose gross debt is in the tens of billions of SAR (e.g., SAR 35.20 Bn in 2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=65,221,237)), which significantly differs in scale from the figures mentioned in your query. Furthermore, the documents do not detail the composition of \"Other reserves\" or provide specific foreign currency exposure breakdown for debt or equity.\n\nHowever, I can conceptually outline the impact of a 5-10% SAR de-pegging scenario on debt-to-equity, debt serviceability, and access to capital, drawing on general Private Equity principles and SABIC's financial profile where relevant:\n\n### Stress-Tested LTM Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Conceptual Impact)\n\nAssuming the entity has debt denominated in a foreign currency (e.g., USD, to which SAR is currently pegged) and its equity is primarily denominated in SAR, a de-pegging of the SAR (meaning SAR weakens against the foreign currency) would have the following effects:\n\n1.  **Increased Debt Burden:** If a significant portion of the SAR 30,269,004 total debt is denominated in USD or another foreign currency, a 5-10% de-pegging of the SAR would directly increase the SAR-denominated equivalent of this foreign currency debt by 5-10%. For instance, if 50% of the debt is USD-denominated, the SAR value of that portion would rise, effectively increasing the total SAR debt.\n\n2.  **Impact on Equity (via \"Other Reserves\"):** A negative shift in \"Other reserves\" of SAR 2,535,918, especially if it includes FX translation losses as you suggest, indicates a prior weakening impact on equity from currency movements. In a de-pegging scenario, further depreciation of the SAR would likely exacerbate these FX translation losses, leading to a further reduction in the SAR-denominated equity. This would be particularly true for foreign-denominated assets whose SAR value would not appreciate sufficiently to offset foreign-denominated liabilities, or if SAR-denominated assets lose value in foreign currency terms.\n\n3.  **Elevated Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** The combined effect of increased SAR-denominated debt and decreased equity (due to further FX losses) would lead to a significantly higher Debt-to-Equity ratio under a stress scenario. This signals increased financial leverage and risk to creditors and equity holders.\n\n### Impact on Debt Serviceability\n\n1.  **Higher Interest Expense (SAR terms):** If the debt is USD-denominated, the SAR equivalent of interest payments would increase by 5-10%, requiring more SAR operating cash flow to service. Even if interest rates remain constant in USD, the cost in SAR rises.\n2.  **Cash Flow Strain:** The entity's cash flow generation, particularly if revenues are predominantly SAR-denominated, would be severely strained. A higher proportion of operating cash flow would be diverted to debt service, reducing funds available for operations, capital expenditures, or dividends. For SABIC, while it maintains a net cash position of SAR 3.01 Bn and top-tier credit ratings (A+/Aa3) [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=13,15,21,65,246), [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=13,15,21), a significant decline in Net Cash from Operating Activities (-33% to ﷼16.36 Bn) and Free Cash Flow (-56% to ﷼6.16 Bn) has been noted [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,61,64), [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15,61,64). Such a scenario, even for a company with a strong initial liquidity profile, could challenge debt serviceability if not managed with hedges or diversified currency revenues.\n\n### Impact on Access to Capital\n\n1.  **Credit Rating Downgrade Risk:** A significantly higher Debt-to-Equity ratio and strained debt service coverage ratios (e.g., Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage Ratio) would likely trigger a review and potential downgrade of credit ratings. For SABIC, its current top-tier ratings (A+/A1 standalone, Aa3 Moody's) [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=5,13,21,64) provide a substantial buffer, but a sharp deterioration in financial metrics due to currency risk could erode this advantage.\n2.  **Increased Cost of Debt:** A lower credit rating directly translates to a higher cost of borrowing for new debt or refinancing existing debt. Lenders would demand a greater risk premium.\n3.  **Reduced Lender Appetite:** Lenders and investors would view the company as riskier, potentially reducing their willingness to provide capital, especially in a volatile currency environment.\n4.  **Equity Market Perception:** A weakened balance sheet and uncertain earnings outlook (due to FX volatility) could depress the stock price and make future equity raises more dilutive or difficult. SABIC's stock already declined by -19.9% in 2024 [2](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=18,19), and a de-pegging would add further pressure.\n\n### Additional Data Needed for a Comprehensive Stress Test:\n\nTo conduct a precise numerical stress test, the following information would be essential:\n*   **Currency breakdown of total debt:** Specific amounts of debt denominated in SAR vs. foreign currencies (e.g., USD).\n*   **Currency breakdown of revenues and operating expenses:** To assess natural hedges and the impact on operating cash flow in SAR terms.\n*   **Detailed composition of \"Other reserves\":** To understand the exact components and how they are affected by FX movements.\n*   **Hedging strategies in place:** Any financial instruments (e.g., currency forwards, swaps) used to mitigate FX risk.\n*   **Maturity profile of debt:** To understand immediate refinancing risks.",

                    "response": "Based on the provided information, I am unable to fully explain the disproportionate capital leakage from the parent as the specific figures for the decline in Parent Retained Earnings (SAR 8,059,563), Non-Controlling Interests (SAR 768,900), and Investments in Associates (SAR 5,801,516) are not present in the provided documents. The only related investment decline mentioned is a SAR 1,170 million impairment on the investment in Clariant AG [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=204), which differs from the figure you provided.\n\nRegarding the NCI dividend outflow, for FY 2024, the total dividend declared was SAR 10.20 billion [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=13, 18, 61, 248). Given that Saudi Aramco holds 70% of the company, the non-controlling interests (NCI) would represent the remaining 30% [8](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=17, 19, 210). Assuming a proportional distribution of dividends, the NCI dividend outflow would be **SAR 3.06 billion** (30% of SAR 10.20 billion).\n\nAn LTM ROIC calculation for core operating assets cannot be reliably performed due to significant inconsistencies and missing data in the provided financial reports for FY 2024. The documents present conflicting figures for profitability, with one report indicating EBIT grew 54% to SAR 5.74 billion, while another details an operating loss of (SAR 720.4 million) [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15, 61, 62, 241). Additionally, the necessary components for calculating invested capital (e.g., specific net working capital and property, plant & equipment for core operating assets) are not available.\n\nWhile a quantitative ROIC cannot be provided, the company's strategy demonstrates an intent to generate value for LP capital holders. This includes a disciplined divestment of non-core assets (e.g., Hadeed and Alba stakes) and reinvestment into higher-growth chemical segments in Asia, such as the SAR 24 billion Fujian complex in China, which is considered a clear and logical strategy to improve long-term returns [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf), [7](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=15, 35, 247). However, the sustainability of the current dividend (payout of 4.87x net income from continuing operations) is highlighted as a risk given the operational downturn [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=248), [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf), [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/sabic%2Fin/sabic_in_sabic_cc_compressed.pdf#page=248).\n\nTo fully address your query, additional financial statements detailing changes in equity, specific balance sheet line items for operating assets, and a reconciliation of the conflicting profitability figures would be required. (General PE insight: Understanding the specific drivers of changes in retained earnings and NCI requires a detailed statement of changes in equity, while an accurate ROIC calculation relies on consistent and detailed financial breakdowns of operating profit and invested capital.)",
