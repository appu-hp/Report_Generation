## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

1. Retained earnings fell by SAR 8.1 billion, yet current provisions and Zakat payables saw releases of over SAR 2.3 billion combined. Deconstruct the LTM bridge for Net Income, and quantify how much of your reported profit is non-cash, stemming from these one-time accrual reversals rather than core operational performance.
2. Your working capital intensity is deteriorating, driven by a SAR 5 billion spike in 'Other current assets and receivables' to SAR 10.3 billion. What is the precise nature, aging, and credit quality of these receivables, and how much of your SAR 19.8 billion in trade payables represents stretched, off-balance-sheet financing from suppliers?
3. Your net PP&E declined by only 2.2% to SAR 112.6 billion, which seems low for a capital base of this scale. Provide the breakdown of sustaining capex versus growth capex for the last three years, and reconcile this with your depreciation schedule to demonstrate you aren't deferring a significant maintenance 'bow wave' that will impair future free cash flow conversion.
4. Investments in associates and JVs dropped by SAR 5.8 billion, while the parent’s retained earnings plummeted. Quantify the cash dividends leaked to Non-Controlling Interests over the last twelve months, and justify this cash drain while the parent's equity base is eroding.
5. Assets held for sale decreased by nearly SAR 12 billion, indicating a major disposal. What was the net cash consideration from this disposal and what was the reported gain or loss booked to the P&L? Show us the pro-forma, go-forward EBITDA and FCF profile after stripping out this divested unit and any associated one-time gains.
6. Your 'Other reserves' balance deteriorated by SAR 2.5 billion, likely due to FX translation losses, while total debt simultaneously increased to SAR 30.3 billion. Provide a sensitivity analysis of your balance sheet and leverage ratios assuming a 10% de-pegging of the Riyal, and quantify your unhedged exposure to non-SAR denominated debt.
