### CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

**Analysis & Overview:**
The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows presents the cash inflows and outflows for the reporting entity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023. All amounts are presented in thousands of Saudi Riyals.

It then accounts for changes in operating assets and liabilities, followed by cash flows from investing activities (dividends, interest received) and financing activities (interest paid, zakat and income tax paid). This comprehensive view highlights the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations and manage its working capital, ultimately leading to the net cash provided by operating activities.

**Investor Relevance:** This statement is critical for valuation as it details the sources and uses of cash across operating, investing, and financing activities, providing insights into the company's ability to generate cash, fund its operations, and meet its financial obligations.

### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The table below illustrates the approximate impact on the DBO if the Group were to change one key assumption, while the other actuarial assumptions remain unchanged. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of the DBO under market conditions at the measurement date. These results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in key actuarial assumptions may have on the total DBO. The sensitivities only apply to the DBO and not to the net amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. Movements in the fair value of plan assets would, to a certain extent, be expected to offset movements in the DBO resulting from changes in the given assumptions.
