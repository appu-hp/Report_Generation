## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

1. Retained Earnings declined by over SAR 8 billion, yet we see a nearly SAR 2.4 billion favorable swing from the release of current provisions and Zakat payable. Can you provide an LTM bridge from EBITDA to Free Cash Flow, specifically isolating the non-cash P&L impact of these releases and the gain or loss on the SAR 11.8 billion disposal of assets held for sale? We need to understand the true quality of earnings and underlying cash conversion.
2. Property, Plant & Equipment stands at over SAR 112 billion, representing a massive capital base. What was the gross maintenance and growth CAPEX for 2024, and how does this compare to the full depreciation charge? We are concerned that the company is underinvesting, creating a significant future CAPEX 'bow wave' that will erode our ROIC.
3. The Current Ratio appears healthy, but Cash of SAR 30.5 billion does not cover Current Liabilities of SAR 45.4 billion. More concerning is the nearly 100% increase in 'Other current assets and receivables' to SAR 10.3 billion. Provide a detailed breakdown of this balance. We need to diligence its quality and liquidity to understand the true working capital intensity of this business.
4. Investments in associates and JVs fell by nearly SAR 6 billion. What percentage of this decline was due to impairments versus disposals, and what was the look-through cash dividend received from these entities in 2024? We need to determine if this SAR 35 billion portfolio is a source of cash or a capital drain that is structurally subordinating our investment at the Parent level.
5. Total debt has increased to over SAR 30 billion while 'Other Reserves' deteriorated by SAR 2.5 billion, likely from currency translation losses. What percentage of your gross debt is denominated in US Dollars, and can you model the pro-forma impact on your debt-to-equity ratio and key debt covenants under a hypothetical 10% de-pegging of the Riyal?
6. While the overall asset base shrank, Trade Receivables grew by over SAR 1.1 billion. Provide a Days Sales Outstanding calculation for continuing operations, along with a detailed aging schedule for the entire SAR 20.4 billion balance. We need to confirm that aggressive revenue recognition isn't being used to mask a deterioration in underlying performance.

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME

1. Gross margin expanded by 350 basis points, driving the entirety of the SAR 2 billion increase in income from operations while revenue was flat. Provide a bridge analysis decomposing this margin improvement between input costs, product mix, and any one-time items. How much of this is sustainable versus a temporary commodity tailwind?
2. Net income was substantially aided by a SAR 1.05 billion reduction in Zakat expense. Please quantify the recurring versus non-recurring nature of this benefit. Stripping out this line item, it appears income before tax and discontinued operations would have been down year-over-year. Is this tax benefit masking a decline in core operational profitability?
3. Note 10 references a SAR 1.39 billion impairment loss within your JV and associates portfolio, a 250% increase from last year. Which specific assets were written down, what was the trigger, and what is the risk of further cascading impairments across the portfolio? This suggests significant capital misallocation.
4. Non-controlling interests were allocated SAR 2.2 billion, or nearly 60% of total net income. It appears the most profitable assets are not wholly-owned. Detail the cash dividend policies and upstreaming restrictions from these subsidiaries. How do you justify a control premium valuation when the majority of the economic benefit leaks to minority partners?
5. The discontinued operation in Note 34 continues to generate losses, with a SAR 557 million drag in 2024. What are the specific trailing cash liabilities, indemnification clauses, or working capital obligations associated with this disposal that we, as the new owner, would be inheriting?
6. Despite flat revenue, the combination of G&A, S&D, and R&D expenses increased by nearly SAR 1.5 billion, an 8.5% rise. This demonstrates significant negative operating leverage. What are the specific drivers of this cost inflation, and what is management's plan to realign the cost structure with the current revenue reality?

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

1. The headline net income swing of over SAR 4.1 billion is driven almost entirely by the discontinued operation. However, total comprehensive income from *continuing operations* attributable to the Parent collapsed by 96% from SAR 1.8 billion to just SAR 73 million. Walk us through the LTM bridge for continuing operations EBITDA. What specific operational factors are driving this core deterioration, and why should we believe this trend will reverse post-acquisition?
2. In 2024, non-controlling interests were allocated SAR 2.2 billion of comprehensive income, while parent equity holders suffered a loss of SAR 395 million. This implies the subsidiaries with minority partners are vastly outperforming the wholly-owned entities. Please identify these specific subsidiaries and detail the dividend policies and cash leakage mechanisms that could structurally subordinate our claim on group-wide cash flow.
3. We see a SAR 1.8 billion negative swing in the 'Exchange difference on translation,' from a gain of SAR 538 million to a loss of SAR 1.26 billion. Quantify the net asset exposure in your key functional currencies. What is the projected P&L and Balance Sheet sensitivity to a hypothetical 10% move against the SAR/USD peg, and what hedging strategies are currently in place?
4. Other Comprehensive Income reveals a combined negative swing of nearly SAR 1.3 billion related to associates and joint ventures between items that will and will not be reclassified. Which specific investments are driving these losses, what is their strategic importance to the core business, and what is our expected capital call exposure to these entities over the next 24 months?
5. The disposal of the discontinued operation stemmed a massive loss, but what were the actual cash proceeds versus the book value write-down? More importantly, what stranded overhead costs from this division have been absorbed by the continuing operations, and how does this impact the 'clean' go-forward margin profile you've presented in the model?
6. Your re-measurement of defined benefit plans contributed a SAR 323 million non-cash gain to OCI, a reversal from a SAR 556 million loss last year. What were the specific changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly discount rates, that drove this swing? How sensitive is your funding status to a 100-basis point change in interest rates, and what are the expected cash contribution requirements over the next three years?

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY

1. Total equity has eroded by over SAR 33 billion, or 15%, in 24 months. In 2023, you paid SAR 16.2 billion in dividends while reporting a SAR 2.8 billion net loss. Reconcile this aggressive dividend policy with the clear deterioration of the capital base. What is the board's philosophy on funding dividends from sources other than operating cash flow, and how can we get comfortable this isn't a precursor to a value-destructive capital raise post-acquisition?
2. In 2023, the parent entity reported a SAR 2.8 billion net loss, yet we see an attribution of SAR 2.4 billion in profit and a SAR 6.2 billion dividend payment to non-controlling interests. Identify the specific subsidiaries driving this divergence. What contractual obligations mandate these cash sweeps to minority partners, and how does this structural subordination impact the free cash flow available to service debt at the parent level?
3. The swing from a SAR 2.8 billion loss to a SAR 1.5 billion profit in 2024 requires scrutiny. Provide an LTM bridge that isolates the contribution from continuing operations versus any gains, cost reductions, or working capital releases from the discontinued operations referenced in Note 20. What is the sustainable, go-forward free cash flow conversion rate of the remaining 'core' business after stripping out all non-recurring items?
4. The decision to eliminate the entire SAR 15 billion statutory reserve and transfer it to retained earnings is a significant accounting maneuver. What specific change in Saudi Arabian corporate law or your bylaws permitted this, or was this an internal decision to create additional dividend capacity? Explain the governance process behind this move, which effectively enabled dividend payments during a loss-making year.
5. The SAR 1.9 billion Other Comprehensive Loss in 2024 wiped out the entire reported net income. Decompose this figure, detailing the specific impact from currency translation adjustments versus mark-to-market losses on cash flow hedges or other securities. What are your underlying functional currency exposures, and what is the sensitivity of your return on invested capital (ROIC) to a 10% move in key currency pairs against the Riyal?
6. The 'Other Reserves' balance is a volatile SAR 4.1 billion liability. Provide a detailed breakdown of this balance. How much is driven by non-cash actuarial adjustments on pension plans, mark-to-market on derivatives, and foreign currency translation? We need to understand the potential for these non-cash items to reverse and create future earnings headwinds or unexpected cash requirements.

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

1. Net operating cash flow plummeted by SAR 8.1 billion, or 33%, year-over-year. A bridge analysis reveals a staggering SAR 12.6 billion negative swing from just three working capital accounts: inventories, receivables, and provisions. Was the SAR 1.3 billion provision build in 2023 a non-recurring accrual that artificially inflated that year's cash flow, and what gives you confidence this severe working capital burn isn't the new structural reality for the core business?
2. Note 10 shows integral joint ventures generated a loss of SAR 765 million yet upstreamed nearly SAR 1.8 billion in dividends. This suggests a cash distribution far in excess of earnings. Is this a return of capital funded by JV-level debt or asset sales, and what covenants or minority shareholder protections could restrict our access to this cash post-acquisition?
3. The discontinued operation resulted in a SAR 2.9 billion fair value re-measurement and significant impairments in 2023. What assurance do we have that the remaining asset base, which consumes nearly SAR 13 billion annually in depreciation and amortization, isn't suffering from similar economic obsolescence? Provide the maintenance versus growth CAPEX breakdown for 'Continuing Operations' for the last 36 months.
4. The gap between reported finance costs of SAR 2.8 billion and cash interest paid of SAR 2.1 billion implies over SAR 700 million in non-cash interest. Is this primarily PIK interest or accruals related to debt at holdcos? Please quantify the impact on our post-acquisition liquidity and pro-forma fixed charge coverage ratios.
5. Income from continuing operations was SAR 4.4 billion, but this was dwarfed by a SAR 6.7 billion negative swing in inventory and receivables. Is this a sign of deteriorating pricing power requiring extended payment terms to move product, or a deliberate inventory build ahead of anticipated supply chain disruption? What is your normalized Days Inventory Outstanding and Days Sales Outstanding projection for the next 12 months?
6. Your entire financial model is predicated on the SAR/USD peg. What stress tests have been conducted on our ROIC and debt covenants under a hypothetical 10% or 20% de-pegging scenario? Quantify the net P&L and Balance Sheet exposure from USD-denominated debt, commodity inputs, and revenue contracts.

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (CONTINUED)

1. The company has spent over SAR 20 billion on capex in the last two years, yet dividends received from associates have declined by 26% and you've divested operations. Walk me through the ROIC on this incremental capital. How much is maintenance capex versus growth capex, and why aren't we seeing a corresponding uplift in cash generation from these investments?
2. Note 34 shows the disposal of a discontinued operation resulted in a net cash outflow of SAR 202 million after accounting for the SAR 1.36 billion in cash transferred out. What contingent liabilities or underperforming assets were packaged into this sale? What does this divestiture signal about the quality of the remaining asset portfolio and management's M&A execution capabilities?
3. Financing activities show over SAR 12.7 billion in dividends paid to shareholders and NCI in 2024, while the company had to issue SAR 12.6 billion in new debt and still saw its cash balance decline by over SAR 3 billion. This implies a dividend policy funded by leverage. What is the board's philosophy on capital allocation, and at what point does this level of capital return begin to jeopardize the balance sheet and starve the core business of necessary reinvestment?
4. We see SAR 2.6 billion in cash dividends paid to non-controlling interests in 2024, following SAR 5.3 billion in 2023. Bridge the underlying EBITDA and free cash flow of these specific non-wholly owned subsidiaries. I'm concerned about structural cash leakage and want to understand what contractual obligations are driving these substantial payments, especially when the parent company is increasing its own debt.
5. In 2024, we deployed another SAR 1 billion into associates and JVs, yet dividends received from this same pool of assets fell 26% year-over-year to SAR 842 million. Reconcile this capital allocation strategy for me. Which specific investments are underperforming, and what is your conviction that new capital deployed into similar structures will generate a return above our cost of capital?
6. The SAR 2.16 billion net cash inflow from 'Short-term investments' represents a significant reversal from the prior year and a material source of funding. What specific assets were liquidated to generate this inflow, what is the remaining balance of this portfolio, and how should we think about the quality and sustainability of this as a funding source versus core operating cash flow?
