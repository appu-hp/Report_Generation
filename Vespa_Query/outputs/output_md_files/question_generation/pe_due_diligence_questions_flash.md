## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

1. The SAR 8 billion decline in Retained Earnings, coupled with the SAR 1.0 billion release of current provisions (Note 24), raises significant red flags regarding the quality of the reported profit. Can management provide a detailed LTM bridge analysis of the retained earnings movement, explicitly disentangling core operational profitability from the impact of provision releases, divestitures (Notes 34, 35), and any non-recurring items that may have artificially propped up reported net income for 2024?
2. Given the SAR 2.5 billion decline in Property, Plant and Equipment (Note 7) and the overall contraction of non-current assets, we need to understand the underlying capital expenditure strategy. Is the reported SAR 4.2 billion in Repairs and Maintenance and the implied net CapEx (PP&E change + depreciation, assuming SAR 11.4 billion annual depreciation) sufficient to maintain the competitive position and asset base, or are we facing a material CAPEX "bow wave" to address deferred maintenance or technological upgrades?
3. With cash and cash equivalents at SAR 30.5 billion against total current liabilities of SAR 45.3 billion, and a significant reliance on trade payables (SAR 19.7 billion) as a financing source, the immediate liquidity position appears constrained. What is the company's detailed Free Cash Flow Conversion for the past year, and what is the working capital intensity of the business? How does management plan to fund the increased non-current debt (up SAR 2.9 billion) and any potential future operational or investment needs without increasing the structural subordination of equity, particularly if short-term investments (SAR 7.6 billion, down from SAR 9.8 billion) are not readily convertible?
4. The worsening negative balance in "Other reserves" (Note 20), declining by SAR 2.5 billion to SAR (4.1) billion in 2024, coupled with a reported SAR 1.2 billion exchange difference on translation, points to significant exposure to currency fluctuations. Considering the SAR/USD peg, what is the company's hedging strategy for its foreign operations and debt? What would be the immediate impact on the LTM debt-to-equity ratio and asset valuations if there were a 5-10% de-pegging or significant regional instability affecting foreign currency translations?
5. Investments in associates and joint ventures (Note 10) have declined by SAR 5.8 billion to SAR 35.4 billion. What is the underlying performance and strategic rationale for retaining these entities, particularly in light of the significant decline in the parent's Retained Earnings? Furthermore, given the overall pressure on Parent's equity, what are the dividend policies and cash flow extraction mechanisms for these Non-Controlling Interest (NCI) held entities, and how do they contribute to or detract from the consolidated Free Cash Flow available to equity holders?
6. The substantial reduction in 'Assets held for sale' from SAR 15.4 billion to SAR 3.6 billion, with associated liabilities completely removed, indicates a major divestiture. What was the net proceeds realized from these sales, what was the gain/loss recognized, and how did these transactions impact the company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) for 2024? More critically, what is the strategic fallout of these divestitures? Does the remaining portfolio retain its competitive edge, and are there any stranded costs or foregone synergies as a result of shedding these assets?

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME

1. The drastic 83% reduction in Zakat expense from SAR 1,269 million in 2023 to SAR 214 million in 2024 is the primary driver behind the reported increase in Net Income from Continuing Operations. Given the significant impact on the "quality" of 2024 earnings, what specific, verifiable changes in the company's zakat base, operations, or regulatory environment led to such a material, non-recurring reduction? We need to understand the sustainability of this Zakat level for future periods to accurately model Free Cash Flow Conversion, as this alone represents a ~25% boost to income before tax.
2. The swing from a SAR 4.08 billion loss from discontinued operations in 2023 to a SAR 557 million loss in 2024 accounts for a substantial portion of the overall Net Income improvement. Provide a detailed LTM bridge analysis of the discontinued operation, specifying whether this reduction in loss is due to asset sales, termination of specific loss-making activities, or a one-time restructuring gain. Furthermore, what is the strategic rationale and fallout from these discontinued operations, and what impact do they have on the remaining core business's competitive positioning, particularly concerning working capital intensity and future revenue growth trajectory?
3. Non-controlling interests consistently capture a disproportionately high share of net income from continuing operations, exceeding the share attributable to equity holders of the Parent in both 2023 and 2024. This raises concerns about structural leakage and the true value accretion for our LPs. Provide a detailed breakdown of the segments or entities where NCI holds controlling interests, explain the rationale behind these structures, and quantify the historical and projected dividend outflows to NCIs. What is the implied ROIC for the Parent's equity in these NCI-heavy entities, and how does it compare to the overall corporate ROIC?
4. The significant deterioration in "Results from associates and non-integral joint ventures" from a SAR 208 million loss in 2023 to a SAR 435 million loss in 2024, coupled with a 250% increase in impairment losses to SAR 1,387 million, indicates serious underlying asset quality issues. What specific assets or investments within these associates were impaired, and what were the triggers for these impairment events? Are these impairments indicative of broader asset obsolescence or competitive pressures within those segments? Provide a pro forma income statement demonstrating the core operational profitability of these ventures *excluding* the impairment, and detail the actions being taken to prevent further value destruction and ensure these are not a recurring drag on earnings.
5. Despite a robust improvement in Income from Operations, the substantial decline in Finance Income by 47% and a concurrent increase in Finance Cost have severely compressed "Income before Zakat and Income Tax." What were the primary drivers for these material movements in the finance line items? Is this indicative of a shift in the company's capital structure, rising interest rate environment, or perhaps significant foreign exchange losses not explicitly detailed here? What is the company's hedging strategy for its foreign currency exposures, particularly given the potential macroeconomic volatility and the SAR/USD peg dynamics, and what would be the LTM debt-to-equity ratio impact under a 5-10% SAR devaluation scenario?

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

1. The dramatic swing from a (384M) net loss in 2023 to a 3.7B net gain in 2024 is heavily offset by a nearly 1.9B negative Net Movement of Other Comprehensive Income. Can management provide an LTM bridge analysis articulating the core operational drivers of this net income improvement, specifically dissecting the recurring versus non-recurring components, and quantifying how much of the 2024 'gain' is driven by non-cash, non-operational OCI re-measurements or financial instrument revaluations rather than sustainable Free Cash Flow Conversion?
2. The 1.25B SAR negative "Exchange difference on translation" in 2024 represents a significant drag on comprehensive income. Given the explicit mention of the SAR/USD peg, what sensitivity analysis has been performed to quantify the impact of a potential de-pegging or even a 5-10% revaluation/devaluation on the company's LTM debt-to-equity ratio, working capital intensity (specifically any foreign currency denominated payables/receivables), and future earnings stability? How much of our reported "Net Income" is effectively insulated from this volatility, and what hedging strategies are in place?
3. The persistent negative Total Comprehensive Income attributable to Equity holders of the Parent (-395M in 2024, -2.4B in 2023) juxtaposed against the substantial positive allocation to Non-controlling Interests (NCI) (2.2B in 2024, 2.5B in 2023) raises serious concerns about structural leakage and value accretion for our LPs. Can management detail the economic rationale for this disproportionate allocation, outline the specific NCI agreements, and provide a clear bridge showing how this structure impacts the ROIC for the Parent's capital? What strategic alternatives are being explored to mitigate this structural subordination of the Parent's equity?
4. Despite improved performance from discontinued operations in 2024, they still account for a substantial (468M) comprehensive loss for the Parent, following a catastrophic (4.2B) loss in 2023. Beyond the immediate financial impact, what is the strategic roadmap and timeline for fully exiting these discontinued operations, and what residual liabilities (e.g., environmental, legal, pension) could potentially manifest as future drains on Free Cash Flow Conversion, independent of any historical accounting provisions? We need a clear "clean break" strategy.
5. The significant and volatile re-measurement gains/losses on defined benefit plans (323M gain in 2024 after a 555M loss in 2023) introduce material earnings volatility. What specific demographic, actuarial, and market-based sensitivities are driving these swings, and what is the funded status of these plans on a true economic (rather than purely accounting) basis? What is the projected cash funding requirement over the next 3-5 years, and how will this impact our projected Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation strategy?
6. The 'Share of other comprehensive (loss) income of associates and joint ventures' (both reclassifiable and non-reclassifiable) collectively reported significant negative contributions in 2024 (approx. 982M total loss). Can management conduct an LTM bridge analysis for these specific ventures, detailing the underlying operational performance, leverage profile, and working capital intensity of these entities? Furthermore, what is the governance structure, and what steps are being taken to either improve their performance or strategically divest from these value-destructive investments to enhance the overall ROIC?
7. The precipitous decline in Total Comprehensive Income attributable to the Parent's 'Continuing operations' from SAR 1.8 billion in 2023 to a mere SAR 72.9 million in 2024 is extremely concerning, especially considering the positive 'Net income' swing. This indicates a severe deterioration in the core business's ability to generate comprehensive value for the Parent's equity holders. What specific operational, market, or strategic factors are driving this decline in value creation from our ongoing core businesses, and what immediate, aggressive actions are being implemented to reverse this trend and restore ROIC?

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY

1. The 2023 statement shows a transfer of SAR 15,000,000 thousand from Statutory Reserve to Retained Earnings, effectively enabling continued dividend payouts despite a SAR 2,772,282 thousand net loss. Was this transfer a one-time maneuver to mask underlying operational cash flow deficiencies, and what are the explicit implications for future dividend sustainability and capital re-investment given the current retained earnings balance of SAR 20,056,576 thousand?
2. Note 20 refers to a 'Reclassification of re-measurement gain on defined benefit plans related to discontinued operation' impacting Other Reserves by SAR (601,895) thousand and boosting Retained Earnings by the same amount in 2024. What was the *actual cash flow impact* of this reclassification and associated 'gain'? How does this non-operational adjustment truly reflect core earnings quality, and what additional one-off costs or liabilities have been incurred or will be incurred due to the discontinued operation that are not yet fully reflected in equity?
3. Building on the 'discontinued operation' mentioned in Note 20, what was the strategic rationale behind this divestiture? Can management provide a comprehensive LTM Bridge Analysis of the discontinued segment's contribution to consolidated revenue, EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow prior to its cessation, and what is the projected impact on the company's forward-looking ROIC and working capital intensity without this segment?
4. Total Equity has declined significantly from SAR 217,617,259 thousand at 1 January 2023 to SAR 183,918,159 thousand by 31 December 2024, a SAR 33.7 billion erosion. Concurrently, the company distributed substantial dividends totaling SAR 26.4 million to the parent and SAR 9.2 million to Non-Controlling Interests over this period. Can management articulate a clear long-term capital allocation strategy that explains this substantial equity depletion and ongoing dividend policy, and how it aligns with maintaining asset health, competitiveness, and avoiding a future CAPEX bow wave?
5. Non-controlling interests (NCI) declined by SAR 3,717,035 thousand over two years, while still receiving significant dividend payouts. What mechanisms are in place to ensure these NCI dividend outflows (SAR 6,194,243 thousand in 2023 and SAR 2,987,818 thousand in 2024) are not a structural leakage of value from the consolidated entity? Furthermore, what is the Free Cash Flow Conversion rate specifically attributable to the NCI segments, and how does it compare to the dividends distributed?
6. The 'Other comprehensive (loss) income' shows a significant negative swing of SAR (1,934,023) thousand in 2024, exacerbating the negative 'Other reserves' balance to SAR (4,112,475) thousand. What are the specific, detailed drivers behind these persistent negative revaluations and adjustments within 'Other reserves'? Are these predominantly unrealized losses on financial instruments, impairments of specific asset classes, or foreign currency translation losses, and what is management's proactive plan to mitigate these value deteriorations and their impact on the company's overall asset quality and macro-economic sensitivity?

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

1. The significant SAR 8.1 billion decline in Net Cash from Operating Activities year-over-year (from SAR 24.5B in 2023 to SAR 16.4B in 2024) occurs while Income from Continuing Operations remained relatively stable. Given the substantial "Fair value re-measurement" and "Gain on sale" adjustments related to discontinued operations (Note 34), what is the normalized Free Cash Flow Conversion for the *core, continuing business* after stripping out these non-recurring items and what is the strategic implication of these discontinued operations beyond the immediate accounting adjustments for the sustainability and quality of future earnings?
2. We observe a material swing in working capital, with inventory and trade receivables moving from significant cash *inflows* in 2023 to substantial cash *outflows* in 2024, contributing heavily to the decline in operating cash flow. Simultaneously, the 'Decrease in provisions' category generated a SAR 1.2 billion cash outflow in 2024, a reversal from the SAR 1.3 billion inflow in 2023. Can management provide an LTM bridge analysis of the key working capital movements for 2024, clarifying the underlying operational drivers for these shifts and their impact on our forward-looking Working Capital Intensity and overall liquidity profile?
3. With depreciation of property, plant and equipment exceeding SAR 11 billion in 2024, combined with significant impairments and write-offs of SAR 720 million, the business appears highly capital intensive with potential issues in asset utility. Given this profile, what is the estimated sustaining capital expenditure required annually to maintain current operational capacity and competitive parity, and how does this compare to the company's historical and projected Free Cash Flow after Debt Service, specifically addressing any potential CAPEX 'bow wave' necessary to avoid future impairments?
4. Note 10 details substantial "Results of associates and non-integral joint ventures" (equity-accounted income) and "Results of integral joint ventures" (equity-accounted loss), yet reveals stable cash "Dividend received from integral joint ventures." What is the consolidated Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) contribution from these various joint ventures, disaggregated by integral versus non-integral, and what is the strategic rationale for the continued equity-accounted losses from integral JVs despite the consistent cash dividends received? Are there any structural leakages or anticipated capital calls expected from these complex arrangements?
5. Given the substantial net interest outflow (SAR 2.13 billion paid versus SAR 1.91 billion received) and significant Zakat and income tax payments exceeding SAR 2.3 billion, what is management's detailed strategy to optimize its funding mix and reduce net interest expense, particularly in a potentially rising interest rate environment? Furthermore, how is the company's cash flow specifically hedged against potential Saudi Riyal/USD peg volatility, and what is the sensitivity of our LTM Free Cash Flow to a hypothetical 5% devaluation of the SAR?
6. The decline in Zakat and income tax paid from SAR 2.99 billion in 2023 to SAR 2.32 billion in 2024, when viewed alongside significant non-cash items like impairments and fair value re-measurements, warrants closer inspection. To what extent does this reduced tax outflow reflect sustainable operational improvements versus the utilization of past losses or non-recurring tax benefits, and what is the projected effective tax rate and cash tax outlay for the next 3-5 years, factoring in any potential changes in tax policy or the unwinding of current tax positions?

## Due Diligence Questions: CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (CONTINUED)

1. The combined SAR 20.5 billion in CAPEX (PP&E and Intangibles) over the past two years represents a significant capital deployment. Can management articulate the "Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)" generated by this sustained investment, particularly in light of decreasing proceeds from asset sales and a negative net cash flow from investing? Furthermore, what is the "Free Cash Flow Conversion ratio" when factoring in this CAPEX, and is the current level of investment primarily maintenance or growth, ensuring competitive parity without creating a massive future CAPEX "bow wave"?
2. We observed a SAR 3.2 billion decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2024, alongside SAR 12.7 billion in total dividend outflows. Given the significant reliance on debt proceeds (SAR 12.6B) and a substantial swing in "Short-term investments, net" (SAR 2.1B inflow), how does management assess the current "liquidity profile"? What is the sustainable "dividend payout ratio" given the declining cash reserves and increasing debt, and what is the "working capital intensity" of the remaining operations, especially after the disposal of discontinued assets?
3. The company continues to make substantial capital contributions to associates and joint ventures (SAR 1.0B in 2024), yet dividend receipts from these entities have declined by 26% year-over-year. What is the explicit "cash-on-cash return or internal rate of return (IRR)" being achieved on these investments, and how do we justify continued deployment of LP capital into entities showing declining cash distributions, indicating potential "structural leakage" or underperforming investments?
4. The significant activity in "Discontinued Operations" and "Assets Held for Sale" in 2024, despite generating gross proceeds, resulted in a net cash outflow when accounting for transferred cash and cash equivalents. Can management provide a detailed "LTM Bridge Analysis" of the impact of these divestitures on the "core Free Cash Flow generation" of the *remaining* business, especially considering the potential for removal of higher-margin or lower-capital intensity segments? What is the "ROIC of the go-forward business" post-divestiture?
5. The "Net foreign exchange loss on cash and cash equivalents" has nearly tripled from SAR 27M in 2023 to SAR 75M in 2024. While seemingly small, this trend indicates growing currency exposure. What is the company's explicit "hedging strategy" against potential fluctuations, particularly given the reliance on a stable SAR/USD peg? What stress scenarios has management run regarding a potential de-pegging or regional instability, and how would such events impact the "LTM debt-to-equity ratio" and the cost of debt financing?
