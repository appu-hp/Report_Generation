What is the LTM Free Cash Flow Conversion adjusted for the impact of these asset disposals and potential one-time P&L benefits from provision/Zakat releases?

The company's financial statements are presented in ₹ million, not SAR, and the figures mentioned in the query (e.g., SAR 7.1 billion decrease in PPE) do not align with the provided data. Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) actually increased from ₹ 1,491.49 million as of March 31, 2024, to ₹ 2,596.42 million as of March 31, 2025 [1](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blue_jet_healthcare_ltd%2Fin%2Fblue_jet_healthcare_ltd_in_fr_2025.pdf#page=165).

Information on 'Repairs and Maintenance' (SAR 4.2B) is not available in the provided documents. For the LTM bridge analysis of PPE for FY2025 (year ended March 31, 2025): The opening net block of tangible assets was ₹ 1,491.49 million as of April 1, 2024 [4](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blue_jet_healthcare_ltd%2Fin%2Fblue_jet_healthcare_ltd_in_fr_2025.pdf#page=185). Additions (CAPEX) to the gross block during FY2025 amounted to ₹ 1,266.53 million [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blue_jet_healthcare_ltd%2Fin%2Fblue_jet_healthcare_ltd_in_fr_2025.pdf#page=184). Depreciation for the year was ₹ 160.41 million [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blue_jet_healthcare_ltd%2Fin%2Fblue_jet_healthcare_ltd_in_fr_2025.pdf#page=184). Net disposals (deductions from gross block of ₹ 9.74 million minus deductions from accumulated depreciation of ₹ 8.44 million) resulted in a net reduction of ₹ 1.30 million [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blue_jet_healthcare_ltd%2Fin%2Fblue_jet_healthcare_ltd_in_fr_2025.pdf#page=184). This leads to a closing net block of ₹ 2,596.31 million (1,491.49 + 1,266.53 - 160.41 - 1.30), which reconciles with the reported closing balance of ₹ 2,596.42 million as of March 31, 2025 [3](https://s3-qa-8byte.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blue_jet_healthcare_ltd%2Fin%2Fblue_jet_healthcare_ltd_in_fr_2025.pdf#page=184). The CAPEX of ₹ 1,266.53 million significantly surpasses the depreciation of ₹ 160.41 million, indicating strong reinvestment in the asset base and refuting any notion of asset stripping. Minor asset disposals (₹ 1.30 million net) do not suggest significant divestments of core operating assets. The overall trend points to growth and reinvestment.",

                "question": "Retained earnings attributable to equity holders of the Parent have significantly declined by SAR 8.1 billion, while 'Non-controlling interests' (Note 21) have also decreased. This suggests either poor operating performance, substantial distributions, or significant impairments within controlled entities. Can management provide a detailed breakdown of the key drivers for the decline in parent-level retained earnings? Specifically, how much of this decline is attributable to operational losses versus dividends paid to non-controlling interests (e.g., the reported SAR 2.6B outflow), and what is the strategic rationale for the current ownership structure, given potential structural leakage impacting the Parent's ability to retain capital for reinvestment?",

Additionally, the strategic rationale for the current ownership structure is not discussed in the provided materials.
